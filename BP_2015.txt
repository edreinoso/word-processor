Introduction from our
group chief executive
Energy is a long-term business. Our projects
often operate over many decades, delivering
energy for growth, development and everyday
life, as well as value for shareholders.
A business that aims to be sustainable has
to order its priorities accordingly. It has to make
safety its top priority. It has to earn and maintain
the support of society. And it has to take action
to help safeguard the environment for future
generations. So issues of sustainability are vital
for the future of our business.
As this report shows, across BP, all of our key
measures of safety performance – process
safety events, leaks, spills and other releases,
and recordable injuries – were better in 2015
than in 2014, and indeed five years ago.
However, while we continued to make
progress, we sadly experienced one workforce
fatality when a contractor died during
renovations at a recently acquired retail site in
Turkey. Our thoughts are with his family and
friends and we are doing all we can to learn
and apply the lessons from this tragic event.
Our aspiration is to have no accidents, no harm
to people and no damage to the environment
– and that means we always have more to do.

We want to play our part in
addressing climate change...
we joined with other oil and
gas companies – through the
Oil and Gas Climate Initiative
and other activities – to
support effective action on
this critical issue.

BP Sustainability Report 2015

Responsible operating
To earn the support of society, we need to be
a responsible operator that is prepared to
recognize and help to resolve many different
concerns – among them environmental issues,
economic impacts and relationships with
communities, suppliers, customers, partners
and governments.
With this in mind, the falling oil price has been
a major challenge for the industry, with sharply
reduced cash flow and earnings affecting the
choices we can make. We have sought to
address difficult choices in a way that is
sustainable, showing resilience in the short
term while continuing to invest in a disciplined
way for long-term growth. And whatever
adjustments we make, safety and risk
management must not be compromised.
Given the challenges, we have had to scale
back our investments, lower our costs and
reduce staff numbers. I recognize the
personal cost this brings for those affected
and their families. In these circumstances
we seek to act fairly, treating people with
respect in line with our well-established
and supportive procedures.

We are working with governments and
suppliers to reduce costs and increase
efficiency along the value chain – and to do
so in a way that is also beneficial for others in
our supply chain. We recognize that some of
the countries where we operate are under
economic strain – as they rely on oil and gas as
their primary source of revenue. Our aim is to
maintain as much activity as possible, where
that can be done competitively.
BP’s economic impact goes far beyond the
products we sell and the people we employ.
According to recent studies, BP contributes
to around 300,000 jobs in its supply chain in
the US and UK alone – around 10 times the
number directly employed. In 2015 we paid
$3.5 billion in taxes worldwide that help
support public spending. We spent $67 million
on community programmes, ranging from
humanitarian relief efforts to investment in
encouraging more young people to take up
careers in science, technology, engineering
and mathematics.
Responsible operating also extends to our
stance on human rights, demonstrated by our
commitment to the UN Guiding Principles and
by our work to introduce human rights clauses
in our contracts with suppliers.
Shortly after marking the fifth anniversary of
the tragic accident on the Deepwater Horizon
in the Gulf of Mexico, we reached agreements
in principle to settle all federal and state claims
arising from the incident. This includes
$7.1 billion to address claims for natural
resource damages, as part of our commitment
to restore the economy and environment of the
region. While this provides some closure and
certainty in legal terms, we will always regret
the accident and remember those who died.
The global energy challenge
The nature of our business means we can
play a major role in the global issues of
economic development and the environment.
The energy we supply can help to improve
living standards, power medical facilities and
provide irrigation and sanitation. Our challenge
is to fulfil this role while also building a
business that can contribute to a sustainable
environment in which greenhouse gas
emissions are reduced.
We want to play our part in addressing climate
change, recognizing that oil and gas are still
projected to make up almost half of the

Overview

world’s energy in 2040 under the International
Energy Agency’s ‘450 scenario’. In 2015 we
joined with other oil and gas companies –
through the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative and
other activities – to support effective action on
this critical issue and help to enable oil and gas
to play a constructive role in the transition to a
lower-carbon future.
Our board unanimously supported a
shareholder resolution in 2015 that requested
we report on how BP is preparing for a
lower-carbon future. As a result, we have
expanded our coverage on these activities
in the energy challenge and climate change
section in this report. In short, we are calling
for widespread carbon pricing that would
incentivize energy efficiency and all forms
of lower-carbon fuel and power. We are
increasing the proportion of natural gas in our
portfolio – gas being a cleaner alternative to
coal – everywhere, from the US and Europe
to China and India. We are pursuing energy
efficiency in our operations as well as
providing advanced fuels and lubricants for
customers. We are running renewable energy
businesses in biofuels and wind and we fund
research into climate change solutions at
leading universities.

Enduring values
We operate in many countries with a range
of political systems, regulatory frameworks
and business cultures. One of our
responsibilities as a global business is to
act consistently with regard to values and
ethical conduct, so people know exactly what
they can expect of BP, regardless of where
they are in the world. That’s why we put
such emphasis on employee adherence to
our code of conduct as well as our core values
of safety, respect, excellence, courage and
one team.
There are many challenges in our industry, but
for more than 100 years, through our values,
business capabilities and relationships, BP has
adapted and navigated through changing
times. We will continue to do so, building a
business that is sustainable in every sense.
Thank you for reading this report.

Group chief executive

global oil and gas companies at the launch of the
first Oil and Gas Climate Initiative report in Paris.
Bottom: At the launch of BP’s Statistical Review
of World Energy 2015 in London.

Our strategy and sustainability
We believe that the best way for BP to
achieve sustainable success is by acting
in the long-term interests of our
shareholders, our partners and society.
We aim to create long-term value for our
shareholders by helping to meet growing
energy demand in a safe and responsible
way. We strive to be a world-class operator,
a responsible corporate citizen and a
good employer.
By supplying energy, we support economic
development and help to improve quality of
life for millions of people. Our activities also
generate jobs, investment, infrastructure
and revenues for governments and local
communities.
Keeping a relentless focus on safety is the top
priority for us. Rigorous management of risk
helps to protect the people at the front line
and the places in which we operate.

We continue to enhance our systems,
processes and standards, including how
we manage the risks that can be created
by the actions of our contractors and the
operators of joint ventures in which we
participate. We understand that operating in
politically complex regions and technically
demanding geographies requires particular
sensitivity to local environments.
We are working to become a simpler business,
reducing complexity and increasing efficiency.
We are strengthening our portfolio of highreturn and longer-life upstream assets, while
building high-quality downstream businesses
with premium products and advanced
technologies. In this way, we are focusing on
where we can generate the most value and not
necessarily the greatest volume of production.
All of this is underpinned by our expertise,
technology and relationships.

Strong financial performance is vital, because
it enables us to make the investments
necessary to produce the energy that society
requires, while rewarding and maintaining the
support of our shareholders.
We can only retain the ability to operate if we
keep the trust of people inside and outside
BP. We must earn people’s trust by being fair
and responsible in everything we do. We
monitor our performance closely and aim to
report in a transparent way. We believe good
communication and open dialogue are vital
if we are to meet the expectations of our
employees, customers, shareholders and
the local communities in which we operate.

by excluding from profit inventory holding gains and losses and their
associated tax effect. Inventory holding gains and losses represent
the difference between the cost of sales calculated using the
average cost to BP of supplies acquired during the year and the cost

of sales calculated on the first-in, first-out method, after adjusting
for any changes in provisions where the net realizable value of the

Stakeholders

Employees

We assess the issues raised by stakeholders, who often have
different priorities for BP. For example, in 2015, some groups
focused on how we are responding to the climate challenge, while
others expressed strong interest in understanding how we create
value in the communities where we operate.

Nongovernmental
organizations

We need to prioritize where we focus our efforts in our reporting.
That means we consider materiality – that is, how important issues
are to our stakeholders and how they could impact BP’s ability
to deliver its strategy. Each year, subject matter experts from
our businesses, policy, risk, government affairs, and safety
and operational risk teams review the existing list of key issues
and scan the horizon for emerging ones.

Shareholders
and analysts

Governments
and regulators

Effectively engaging with our stakeholders – the many
individuals and organizations who are affected in some way by
BP’s activities – is an important and everyday part of our business.
Whether it is in our role as an energy provider, employer, or as
a business that generates revenues and helps to boost local
economies, we engage with a wide and varied group of
stakeholders with differing concerns and priorities. The input
and feedback we receive from BP’s stakeholders throughout
the year help inform our approach to reporting.

And, we validate the issue selection and prioritization with senior
leaders, external stakeholders and our board committee responsible
for sustainability-related issues – confirming they are aligned with
BP’s principal risks.

We define each issue to help us understand and respond to a specific
stakeholder concern, which may evolve over time. We report externally
on issues rated as medium to high in terms of materiality. The top seven

Contractors on
drilling safety

Socially responsible
investors on climate
change reporting
Climate change, and how it could impact BP’s
long-term resilience, continues to be high on
the socially responsible investors’ (SRI) agenda.
This gained more prominence in 2015 in light
of the UN climate change conference in Paris.
Also, a coalition of shareholders filed a special
resolution requesting that we report more on
BP’s preparation for a lower-carbon future. The
resolution, which was supported by our board,
specifically wanted more information on our:
• Emissions management.
• Post-2035 portfolio resilience.
• Investments in lower-carbon energy
and research and development.
• Strategic key performance indicators
and executive incentives.
• Public policy activities.
We engaged with SRIs throughout the year to
get their views. We held a webcast explaining
the shareholder resolution and undertook a
series of meetings in Europe, the UK and US,

Good communication with our contractors is key
to maintaining safe and reliable operations across
BP. We discussed challenges the industry faces
in improving safety performance with around
25 of our drilling contractors and wells service
providers at our annual global wells organization
safety workshop.
Participants acknowledged the need to share
what could be working better and also the
difficulty of openly talking about such topics
in the current market environment. Working
together, we use the outcomes from the
discussion to inform and enhance our safety
approaches and collaboratively review
actions taken.
“Having attended the workshops for the last
couple of years, what is helping is getting the
perspective of the other contractors and then
taking that into our collaboration with BP.
One of the best things we can do to enhance
safety is to get inspiration – be provoked, or
moved – to do some things differently and
better than before.”

The energy challenge
and climate change
Today’s challenge is to manage and meet
growing worldwide demand for energy while
addressing climate change and other
environmental and social issues.

GDP, energy and emissions
Energy use and related CO2 emissions are expected to increase
at slower rates than economic growth, thanks to innovation
leading to energy efficiencies and lower-carbon intensity.

BP Sustainability Report 2015

Energy outlook
Over the next few decades, population and income are projected
to rise, resulting in greater demand for energy that is affordable,
secure and sustainable.
Access to affordable and secure energy is
essential for economic prosperity. Energy
provides heat and light for homes, fuel for
transportation and power for industry. And,
everyday objects – from plastics to fabrics –
are derived from oil.
The world economy is likely to more than double
from 2014 to 2035, largely driven by rising
incomes in the emerging economies and a
projected population increase of 1.5 billion.
We expect world demand for energy to increase
by as much as 34% between 2014 and 2035.
This is after taking into account improvements
in energy efficiency, a shift towards less
energy-intensive activities in fast-growing
economies, governmental policies that
incentivize lower-carbon activity and national
pledges made at the 2015 UN climate
conference in Paris.
There are more than enough energy resources
to meet this growing demand, but there are a
number of challenges.
Affordability
Fossil fuels are currently cheaper than
renewables but their future costs are hard to
predict. Some fossil fuels may become more
costly as the difficulty to access and process
them increases; others may be more affordable
with technological progress, as seen with US
shale gas. While many renewables remain
expensive, innovation and wider deployment
are likely to bring down their costs.
Supply security
Energy resources are often distant from the
hubs of energy consumption and in places
facing political uncertainties. More than half of
the world’s known oil and natural gas reserves
are located in just eight countries.

Carbon intensity
Fossil fuels – though plentiful and currently more
affordable than other energy resources – emit
carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse
gases through their production and use in
homes, industry and vehicles. Renewables are
lower carbon but can have other environmental
or social impacts, such as high water
consumption or visual intrusion.

All sorts of energy are required
We believe a diverse mix of fuels and
technologies is needed to meet growing energy
demand, while supporting the transition to a
lower-carbon economy.
Oil and natural gas
Over the next few decades, we think oil and
natural gas are likely to continue to play a significant
part in meeting demand for energy. They currently
account for around 56% of total energy
consumption, and we believe that will decrease
to about 54% in 2035. For comparison, under the
International Energy Agency’s most ambitious
climate policy scenario (the 450 scenario1), oil and
gas would still make up 50% of the energy mix in
2030 and 44% in 2040 – assuming carbon capture
and storage is widely deployed.
Oil is a good source of energy for transportation
as it has a high energy density. That means
vehicles go further on less weight and volume of
fuel than alternatives. Also, oil’s liquid form makes
it easy to move around, globally and locally. For
these reasons, we expect oil to still account for
almost 90% of transportation fuels in 2035 –
compared with 94% today.

Natural gas is likely to play an increasing role in
meeting global energy demand, because it’s
available at scale, relatively low cost and lower
carbon than other fossil fuels. By 2035 gas is
expected to provide 26% of global energy, placing
it on a par with oil and coal.
We believe shale gas will contribute more than half
of the growth in natural gas globally between 2014
and 2035. In the US, the growth of shale gas has
already had a significant impact on gas demand
as well as CO2 emissions, which have fallen back
to 1990s levels.
The increasing gas supply in the US and other
countries is encouraging the use of liquefied
natural gas worldwide, which is expected to
double between 2014 and 2035.
Renewables
Renewables are the fastest-growing energy
source. Over the past few years, there has been
rapid expansion of the use of solar power due
to cost reduction in manufacturing and public
subsidies. That said, renewables, excluding
large-scale hydroelectricity, currently account for
around 3% of energy consumption. While they
are starting from a low base, we estimate that
by 2035 they will contribute around 9% of total
global energy demand.

There is a

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
states that warming of the climate system
is unequivocal, and is in large part due to an
increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
from human activities. It makes clear that
substantial and sustained reductions of GHG
emissions are needed to limit warming to 2°C,
the threshold recognized by governments as
limiting the worst impacts of climate change.

Not an easy solution
Achieving substantial and rapid GHG emissions
reductions will be challenging, especially in light
of growing demand for energy in emerging
economies. The scale, cost and long life of much
of the world’s existing energy infrastructure could
slow down the transition to a lower-carbon future.
Some potentially important lower-carbon
technologies – including carbon capture and
storage, electric vehicles and nuclear energy – face
significant political, infrastructure, logistical or cost
challenges. The costs for some technologies, like
solar, have fallen, while others have remained high.
As a result, some governments have reduced their
levels of support if not required or too costly.

BP Sustainability Report 2015

80-90

%

of CO2 emissions from oil and gas
products are from their use by
consumers

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from energy make up around
two thirds of all global man-made greenhouse gas emissions.
This energy supplies many staples in today’s world: heat,
light, industrial power and transportation. Agriculture and
land-use changes, such as deforestation and clearing land
for crops, account for about a quarter of the emissions.
BP’s Energy Outlook projects that global CO2 emissions from
fossil fuels may be 20% higher in 2035 than they were in
2014, partly as a consequence of coal use in rapidly growing
economies. This is not what BP wants to see, but what we
currently thinks is likely.

About 60% of potential CO2 emissions from known fossil
fuel reserves are from coal, the most carbon-intensive fossil
fuel. By comparison, gas would account for around 15% of
potential CO2 emissions and is the least carbon-intensive
fossil fuel.

Around 80-90% of CO2 emissions from oil and gas
products are from their use by consumers, with the
remainder generated during their extraction and
development.

Taking action
Meeting the climate challenge requires efforts by
all – governments, companies and consumers.
Governments must lead by providing a clear, stable
and effective climate policy framework. In BP we
consider placing an economy-wide price on carbon
– either through carbon taxes or a cap-and-trade
system – as the best solution. This allows
companies to provide energy competitively
while taking steps to limit GHGs, and enables
consumers to make informed choices.
We are working with peers in the sector to highlight
and help address this global challenge. For example,
we are active participants in the Oil and Gas Climate
Initiative (OGCI), a voluntary, CEO-led industry
initiative that aims to catalyse meaningful action on
climate change through best practice sharing and
collaboration. Combined, OGCI members produce
over one-fifth of the world’s oil and gas.
BP is playing its part by calling for a price on
carbon, providing lower-carbon products including
natural gas and renewables, pursuing energy
efficiency and supporting research.

How can emissions be reduced?
There are many ways to decrease GHGs, and
some can have more immediate impact than
others. BP calculates that each of these options
could cut global emissions by the same
amount.
Alternatives with equal benefit:

1%

shift from coal to gas
power generation

6%

increase in nuclear
power generation

2%

improvement in vehicle
energy efficiency

or

10

%

increase in renewable

Calling for a price on carbon
BP believes that carbon pricing by governments is the most
comprehensive and economically efficient policy to limit
greenhouse gas emissions.

Our view is that putting a price on carbon will
reduce emissions at a larger scale and at lower
cost than alternative policy measures, by
reducing the demand for carbon-intensive
products. It might make our operations and
products more costly in some cases. We
consider that this is fair – as long as the carbon
price impacts all GHG emitters equally –
and we are keen to compete on this level
playing field.

A global carbon price
We were pleased to see that the agreement
made at the 2015 UN climate conference in
Paris creates the possibility for carbon pricing
to help deliver global goals and national
contributions for reducing GHG emissions.
We recognize different national prices are a
necessary and practical first step but would
like to see convergence towards a single
global carbon price over time.

In the meantime, any national carbon pricing
mechanism should address the impacts of
unequal international competition. Otherwise
there is a risk of carbon leakage, meaning
that energy-intensive industrial activity and
investment could just move from one
country to a less-regulated part of the
world – potentially increasing their associated
GHGs worldwide.

What BP is doing
BP has long publicly supported measures to
put a price on carbon emissions, including our
endorsement of the World Bank carbon pricing
statement in 2014.
We stepped up our advocacy in 2015, joining
seven other oil and gas companies in calling
on the UN and governments to put a price
on carbon. Work is continuing through
face-to-face meetings between the
companies, select governments and UN
representatives to share lessons learned
and views on policy to effect change.

“If governments act to price carbon,
this discourages high-carbon options
and encourages the most efficient
ways of reducing emissions widely,
including reduced demand for the
most carbon-intensive fossil fuels;
greater energy efficiency; the use of
natural gas in place of coal; increased
investment in carbon capture and
storage, renewable energy, smart
buildings and grids; off-grid access
to energy; cleaner cars; and new
mobility business models and
behaviours.”
From the 25 June 2015 letter to the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change from the CEOs of BG, BP, Eni, Shell,
Statoil and Total.

We have also joined the Carbon Pricing
Leadership Coalition, which brings together
senior representatives from government,
the private sector and civil society to expand
the use of carbon pricing.

evaluating large new projects.

countries have put or are
putting in place carbon pricing
mechanisms.

How carbon pricing works
We believe a global carbon price would help to provide
the right incentives for everyone – energy producers and
consumers alike – to play their part.
Where it starts
Governments: Across
the world, more than 40
countries are developing
mechanisms to put a price
on carbon. These government
initiatives aim to provide
financial incentives to
producers and consumers
to reduce GHG emissions.
This can be implemented
either through a carbon tax
or a cap-and-trade scheme.

How it works

Who it affects

Carbon tax: This imposes a direct
fee on GHGs emitted. This carbon
price is achieved by setting a
consistent cost per tonne of CO2
(or CO2 equivalent) released into
the atmosphere.

Energy producers: Producers, such as BP,
pay for the GHGs emitted by their operations.
They are encouraged to seek solutions to
reduce their emissions – through energy
efficiency and innovation in lower-carbon
technologies.

Cap-and-trade system: This
issues permits for sectors or whole
economies to emit GHGs up to a
total fixed limit or ‘cap’. Participants
must acquire these permits to
cover their own emissions, with
the price set by market forces.

End consumers: Businesses and households
ultimately pay more for carbon-intensive goods
and services. They are motivated to use less
energy, choose more energy-efficient products
and favour lower-carbon energy products.

Putting a price on carbon – one that treats all
carbon equally, whether it comes out of a
smokestack or a car exhaust – would make
energy efficiency more attractive and
lower-carbon energy sources, such as natural
gas and renewables, more cost competitive.
A carbon price incentivizes both energy
producers and consumers to reduce their GHG
emissions. Governments can put a price on
carbon via a well-constructed carbon tax or
cap-and-trade system.

Working towards a lower-carbon future
BP is helping to meet the demands of a lower-carbon future through
our portfolio choices and by working to reduce the carbon footprint
of our products.
Supplying natural gas
Natural gas produces about half as much
carbon dioxide (CO2) as coal when burned
to generate power.
Some argue that gas for power is not much better
than coal for climate, when taking into account its
full life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
This is because some GHG emissions, particularly
methane, occur during the production and supply
of both coal and gas. Only a small amount of
methane is emitted, but it is a powerful GHG
that traps more heat than CO2.
Most government, industry and academic
studies that have compared gas and coal for
power have found that, over the long term, gas
has significantly lower life cycle GHG emissions
than coal. Also, based on our own operational
experience, we believe methane emissions
from gas developments can be economically
and technically controlled to increase the
climate advantage of gas over coal further.

Investing in renewables
Renewables will play an increasingly important
role in achieving a lower-carbon world. They
account for around 3% of global energy today,
excluding large-scale hydroelectricity, but they
are the fastest-growing energy source.
BP invests in renewable energy where we can
build commercially viable businesses at scale.
Much of our activity is in biofuels in Brazil. We
own and operate three sugar cane ethanol
mills, farming around 127,000 hectares. We
estimate that, as a result of BP’s 2015 ethanol
production, approximately 0.7 million tonnes
of CO2 was avoided. That’s equal to 334,000
fewer European cars on the road for a year.

Around half of our current Upstream portfolio
is natural gas and we are increasing that
proportion over time. BP is developing major
gas supply chains to Europe, including our
Southern Gas Corridor project to bring gas from
the Caspian Sea to European markets. BP is
also supplying gas to China and India, two
countries that are likely to account for more
than half of the growth in global energy demand
up to 2035.
Emissions reduction – working with others
Our collaborations include:
• World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring by 2030
initiative.
• World Bank’s Global Gas Flaring Reduction
partnership.
• Climate and Clean Air Coalition Oil and Gas
Methane Partnership.
• Oil and Gas Climate Initiative.

We are among the top wind energy producers
in the US, with interests in 16 wind farms
across the country. Our share accounts for
a combined wind energy capacity of 1,556
megawatts of electricity – that is enough
to power all the homes in a city the size of
Dallas. And, we calculate that our wind
activities helped avoid around 2.7 million
tonnes of CO2 in 2015.
Additionally, Air BP is the world’s first
supplier of commercial jet biofuel, supplying
Lufthansa, SAS and KLM using the existing
fuelling infrastructure at Norway’s Oslo airport.
	See page 31 for more information on
renewable energy.

Developing gas in Oman –
low emission by design
At our Khazzan project in Oman, we expect
to deliver around 1.5 billion cubic feet of gas
per day – equal to about 40% of Oman’s total
daily domestic gas supply. The project covers
an area more than twice the size of London
and will comprise 325 wells over 15 years.
From the outset, we have designed Khazzan
to be an inherently low-emission concept.
For example, we have built a central
processing facility where we remove water
and condensate from the gas produced at
all well sites in order to create market quality
gas. Centralized gas processing takes away
the need for processing equipment at each
individual well site, which can be a source
of additional methane emissions in gas
production.
Additionally, the processing facility at Khazzan
is powered by the gas we produce, and
provides electricity that powers well-site
equipment such as valves and pneumatic
devices. This reduces the amount of
methane emitted – especially when
compared with remote tight gas
development projects that use natural gas as
their power source. And, if the sites are too
remote to connect to the central facility, we
install solar panels to power equipment.
This low emission approach has business
benefits too. The Khazzan central processing
facility is twice as efficient as a typical oil
and gas field – thanks to the ability to use
recycled waste heat from the gas turbines
elsewhere at the facility.
The Khazzan project is a first of its kind
design for BP and will play an integral role
in increasing the proportion of gas in
our portfolio.

The International Energy Association
estimates that energy efficiency will contribute
approximately half of the emission reductions
required by 2030 to stay below the 2°C
threshold.
BP is focusing on ways to improve the energy
efficiency of our operations and – even more
importantly – the use of our products. Only
10-20% of emissions associated with oil and
gas products come from the processes used
to make them, with the remainder coming
from consumer use in industry, power plants,
buildings and transportation.

Supporting research
Technological innovation underpins our efforts
for more efficient production and use of fossil
fuels, as well as for longer-term alternatives to
fossil fuels. We deepen our understanding of
future energy, technology and climate change
trends through in-house research and in
partnership with leading academics.
We have been supporting Princeton
University’s Carbon Mitigation Initiative since
its inception in 2000. It brings together
scientists, engineers and policy experts to
design carbon mitigation strategies that are
safe and effective as well as affordable.
BP’s Energy Sustainability Challenge
programme, based on the research of 15
university partners from around the world,
looks at the potential effects of natural resource
scarcities on energy supply and demand. For
example, climate change may increase water
scarcity, so the programme looks at how
energy can be supplied, taking into account
competing pressures for the use of water.

conventional technology, Zhuhai 3 delivers around
65% lower GHG emissions.
BP is working to reduce emissions from gas
production through programmes to detect and
repair methane leaks and to reduce flaring. And,
for our oil production activities, new projects
must seek alternatives to flaring and venting as
a means to dispose of associated gas; this could
include capturing the gas for reuse or re-injection
in the reservoir.
At our refineries, we use the Solomon Energy
Intensity Index® (EII®) to measure energy
performance. This well-established industry
benchmark allows us to compare performance
of our refineries with each other and with our
peers. Each of our refineries set and track
progress against an EII® target specific to its
circumstances.
Efficient use of our products
We provide increasingly energy-efficient and
high-performance products to our customers,
meaning if less fuel is used, fewer GHGs are
emitted.
Over the past decade we have been developing
Castrol lubricants with lower viscosity, which
helps manufacturers to improve the fuel
efficiency of their vehicles.

Additionally, we have been investing in start-up
companies to better understand evolving
alternative and advanced technologies such as
electric vehicles, batteries and bio-lubricants.
One of these companies – Solidia – has
developed a technology to make the production
of concrete less carbon-intensive. Cement is
produced in a way that generates less CO2 and
is then cured or hardened by the addition of
CO2. This approach can result in up to a 70%
reduction in the concrete’s carbon footprint and
is being rolled out through a partnership with
LaFarge across the US and Europe.
Research – working with others
BP partners include:
• BP Institute, University of Cambridge.
• Carbon Mitigation Initiative, Princeton.
• Center for International Environment and
Resource Policy, Tufts University.
• Energy Bioscience Institute, University
of California.
• Energy Technologies Institute, UK.

Pursuing efficient operations
and products

We estimate that – when compared with our
2004 Castrol formulation – our more recent
lubricants have helped avoid more than five
million tonnes of CO2 over the past 10 years.
That’s the CO2 equivalent of removing almost
a quarter of a million European cars from the
road each year.
Our premium Ultimate fuels also contribute
to better fuel efficiency by restoring the
cleanliness of the engine and improving
combustion performance. And, we provide
customers with information on how to maximize
the fuel efficiency of their vehicles, by taking
steps such as accelerating and braking
moderately and using the correct tyre pressure.
We work in partnership with vehicle and
equipment manufacturers to achieve more
efficient use of our fuels and engine oils.
In Europe for example, Ford’s EcoBoost
engines – used in the Fiesta, Focus, Mondeo
and other models – are engineered with
specially formulated advanced Castrol oils,
which help to improve fuel efficiency and
reduce emissions.

GHG emissions management and
performance.

Carbon capture and storage
Implementation of carbon capture and
storage (CCS) technology could enable
continued large-scale use of fossil fuels in
a tightly carbon-limited world. But it faces
many barriers: high costs, commercial
complexity, and an uncertain business
and policy environment.
BP has built capability in CCS technology
through projects such as the In Salah CO2
storage project in Algeria and through
developing hydrogen-fired power projects
in Abu Dhabi and California. Additionally,
the CO2 Capture Project, a BP-operated
joint partnership, is developing and piloting
technology and demonstrating safe and
secure geological containment. This
initiative was recognized in 2015 for its
work in improving the understanding of
the CCS life cycle.
We share our experience with, and support
for, CCS through various other industry
initiatives.

Resilience – now and in the future
BP is working to help make sure our business is sustainable – commercially,
environmentally and in a lower-carbon future.
We believe having a balanced portfolio with
flexibility and a dynamic investment strategy –
supported by preparation for potential climate
impacts to our facilities – give us the resilience
to meet today’s challenges as well as setting
us up for the future.

A balanced portfolio with flexibility
BP strives for a balanced portfolio in terms of
its resources, geography and businesses.
This helps us manage changing circumstances,
both expected and unforeseen.
The diversity of our portfolio – upstream,
downstream and renewables – helps us
to provide energy to support economic
development and to contribute to a lower-carbon
future. Natural gas accounts for around half
of our Upstream portfolio and our biofuels
production has grown year-on-year.
We also think it’s important to have geographical
diversity of operations. This gives us access to a
variety of resources and markets, and provides
robustness to geopolitical events.
And, by having upstream and downstream
businesses and well-established trading
capabilities, we have a cushion to oil price
volatility as downward pressures in one part of
the group can create opportunities in another.

Dynamic investment strategy
BP’s proved reserves are produced, and
historically replaced, over a 13-year time

frame on average. This means we have time to
adapt our investment strategy to changes in
policy, market or technology conditions.
Greenhouse gas policy
We assess how potential carbon policy could
affect our businesses now and in the future. This
is particularly important as we expect, by 2020,
around two thirds of BP’s direct emissions will
be in countries subject to carbon policy.
To help us anticipate greater regulatory
requirements for greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions, we factor a carbon cost into our own
investment decisions and engineering designs
for large new projects and those for which
emissions costs would be a material part of the
project. In industrialized countries this is $40 per
tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent. We
also stress test at a higher carbon price.
We consider this carbon cost, along with other
factors, when assessing the economic value of
the investment. To date, the internal carbon price
has not resulted in a no-investment decision.
The real benefit is that it, along with energy
efficiency considerations, has encouraged
projects to be set up in a way that will have
lower GHG emissions.
Supply and demand
We make regional and global assessments
of energy supply and demand in our Energy
Outlook and we undertake detailed analysis
of the transport sector.

Flexibility in portfolio choices
We renew our portfolio to meet demand for our products. We have flexibility in investment
decisions as our current portfolio matures and external circumstances change.

2035

Our Energy Outlook takes the long-term view,
considering a wide variety of factors. That
means that we try to look past the near-term
volatility in oil prices and identify the structural
trends, such as sustainable technological
advancements enabling faster growth in shale
gas, tight oil and some renewables.
While our Energy Outlook presents what we
think is likely to happen, we recognize that there
are many uncertainties. One key uncertainty is
climate change policy, so we developed an
alternative ‘faster transition’ scenario. It’s based
on a carbon price of $100 per tonne in the OECD
and other leading economies, with at least $50
per tonne elsewhere; tougher CO2 standards for
vehicles; and 80% of estimated potential energy
efficiency gains for industry and buildings in
place by 2035. In this scenario, oil and gas would
still account for more than 50% of total energy
consumption, with renewables at 15%.
We update our Energy Outlook on an annual
basis to be able to inform our strategy. We also
consider external assessments such as those
by the International Energy Agency and
International Transport Forum.

UN conference on climate
change – COP21
BP welcomes the direction provided by the
Paris Agreement for countries to determine
their contributions to holding temperature rise
well below 2°C.
Although developed countries are still
expected to lead, the agreement applies to all
participating countries. It commits all countries
to submit climate pledges, regularly report on
progress and declare new and more ambitious
contributions every five years, following
reviews of collective progress.
We are pleased the agreement creates the
possibility for carbon pricing to help deliver
global goals and national contributions. We
will continue to work in our own right, and
collaboratively with other companies in the
Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, to evolve our
businesses towards, and help deliver, the
aims of the agreement. We continue to work
with all relevant stakeholders to play our part.

We view the lower oil prices seen in late
2014 through early 2016 as a return to price
volatility. That said, we have been reviewing
our strategy against this environment as we
expect prices to remain lower for longer.
Importantly, in light of the current environment,
the break-even price of many of our investments
goes down as industry suppliers reduce their
costs to meet with market conditions.
Cost of supplying oil and gas
The extraction of oil and gas varies in cost
according to a number of factors, but most
significantly the nature of the asset class or
resource. For example, it is generally cheaper
to extract conventional onshore oil and gas
than oil sands or deepwater resources.
Technology advancements and government
incentives are other key contributors.
Through our Technology Outlook, launched in
2015, we have forecast the cost of supplying
oil and gas to 2050 – taking into consideration
expected technological improvements. We
have also considered the impact of a carbon
price at $80 per tonne. We use this as a lens
to review the future attractiveness of our
various oil and gas resources.

Governments can impact investment into
various resources, depending on which types
they incentivize through taxes and subsidies.
Evolving technology
We undertake periodic and thorough reviews
of potential innovation out to 2050 and
collaborate with external technology-focused
bodies. Our Technology Outlook examines
what technology can do in terms of access
to primary energy resources and how it might
change the power and transport sectors,
especially in the context of reducing carbon
emissions.
We recognize that some emerging
technologies could lead to rapid improvements
in the performance of energy storage devices
like batteries, solar conversion and the use
of hydrogen as a fuel. We monitor these
developments and invest in start-up
companies to understand and participate in
these potentially disruptive technologies.

greater precipitation – on our new projects
from the start, in the design phase. We have
guidance for existing operations and projects
on how to assess potential climate change
risks and impacts – to enable mitigation steps
to be incorporated into project planning,
design and operations.
For example, we decided to place some
of the new South Caucasus pipeline deeper
underground to avoid potential washouts
due to flooding. And, in Iraq, where we are
redeveloping an existing oilfield, we are
selecting new equipment to better withstand
extended periods of high temperatures.

Courage
One Team

Our Cherry Point refinery in the US employs
about 900 people and processes more than
234,000 barrels of crude oil a day.

Business ethics
We define our commitment to high ethical standards in our code
of conduct. It is based on our values and clarifies the principles
and expectations for how we work at BP.
Our code of conduct covers operating safely,
responsibly and reliably; respecting and valuing
our people; how we work with our partners
and suppliers; protecting BP’s assets; and
working with governments and communities,
including our commitment to human rights.

We provide our employees with training
and communications on how to apply the
code’s principles. Managers are responsible
for helping their teams understand how
the code guides the way we work and are
expected to have conversations with their
teams throughout the year.
Each year, our employees certify that they
understand the code, have abided by their
responsibilities and have reported any
breaches of which they were aware. In 2015
we extended this certification process to
include our board members, who all certified
during the year.

Speaking up
We are committed to providing an open
environment where our employees, contractors
and other third parties are comfortable speaking
up whenever they have a question about our
code or see something they feel to be unsafe,
unethical or potentially harmful.
Employees are encouraged to discuss their
questions or concerns with their managers,
relevant supporting teams or BP’s confidential
helpline, OpenTalk. A total of 1,158 people
contacted OpenTalk with concerns or enquiries
in 2015 (2014 1,114, 2013 1,121).
We look for opportunities to reinforce our
culture of speaking up. For example, we
identified that the number of concerns raised
by our employees in Azerbaijan, Georgia and
Turkey was lower than expected. Following a
survey, we discovered that employees were
not aware of the channels available to raise
concerns or were reluctant to use them.
To address this, we delivered more than 100
training sessions to employees, contractors
and suppliers. The sessions reinforced the
importance of ethical behaviour, explained
how to raise concerns and outlined our policy
of zero tolerance towards retaliation. Since the
programme began in 2013, the number of
concerns raised in the region increased from
37 to 58 in 2015.

Consequences for misconduct or retaliation
range from coaching and performance
management through to dismissal.
Our businesses dismissed 132 employees for
non-conformance with our code of conduct or
unethical behaviour in 2015 (2014 157, 2013
113). This excludes dismissals of staff
employed at our retail service stations.

Anti-bribery and corruption
We operate in some of the world’s highest risk
countries from an anti-bribery and corruption
perspective, as measured by Transparency
International’s Corruption Perceptions Index.
Our code of conduct explicitly prohibits
engaging in bribery and corruption in any form.
We have a responsibility to our employees,
our shareholders and to the countries and
communities in which we do business to be
ethical and lawful in all our dealings.

(PAC) to facilitate employee involvement and
to assess whether contributions comply
with the law and are publicly disclosed.
The way we interact with governments
depends on the legal and regulatory framework
in each country. We engage across a range
of issues relevant to our business, from
compliance with regulation to understanding
our tax liabilities to collaborating on social
and community initiatives.
In some instances we will engage with
governments through lobbying, a process
that in many countries is strictly regulated
by national laws. For example, in the US we
are required to file quarterly and twice-yearly
lobbying disclosure reports. Any lobbying
activity we undertake is done in accordance
with local laws and our code of conduct.

Our group-wide anti-bribery and corruption
policy applies to all BP-operated businesses.
The policy governs areas such as the inclusion
of appropriate clauses in contracts, risk
assessments and training. We provide training
to those employees for whom we believe it is
most relevant, for example, depending on the
nature or location of their role or in response
to specific incidents.
Before working with suppliers, we conduct
assessments in order to determine the degree
of bribery and corruption risk posed. This helps
us put mitigation plans in place when needed.
We also check suppliers once contracts are
in place. For example, in Upstream we carry
out anti-bribery and corruption audits on a
risk-prioritized basis to confirm whether
suppliers are complying with related
contractual terms. We issued a total of 35
audit reports in 2015 (2014 36, 2013 44).

We recognize the rights of our employees to
participate in the political process, provided
they make it clear that they do not represent
BP and do not use BP time, property or
equipment. We require employees who plan
to seek or accept a role in public office to
notify their line manager in advance.
Employees’ rights to participate in political
activity are governed by the applicable laws
in the countries in which we operate. For
example, in the US we support the operation

How we operate

Our code applies to all employees, officers
and members of the board. We expect
and encourage our contractors and their
employees to act in a way that is consistent
with our code and we take appropriate actions
where we believe they have not met our
expectations or their contractual obligations.

Employee dismissals

Our people
BP’s performance depends on having a highly skilled,
motivated and talented workforce that reflects the diversity
of the societies in which we operate.
Our aim is to develop the capabilities of our
workforce with a focus on the skills required
to maintain safe and reliable operations.
As we adapt to the current low oil price
environment, we are reducing activity and
simplifying the way we work. Some of this has
resulted in job losses. Our employee headcount
at the end of 2015 was 4,700 lower than the
previous year.
Our total upstream workforce – including
employees and contractors – is now 20%
smaller than it was in 2013, with a reduction of
around 4,000 expected in 2016. We are aiming
for an upstream workforce of approximately
20,000 by the end of 2016. We expect to reduce
our downstream workforce roles by more than
5,000 by the end of 2017 compared with 2014.
By the end of 2015, we had already achieved a
reduction of more than 2,000.

Attracting and retaining
the right people
The complex projects we work on – from
exploring for new sources of energy through
to distributing hydrocarbons safely around the
world – require a wide range of specialist skills.
We have a bias towards building capability and
promoting from within the organization and we
complement this with selective external
recruitment for specialist roles.
We decided to maintain graduate recruitment
in 2015, albeit at a reduced level, with 298
graduates joining BP during the year (2014 670,
2013 814). We have worked to maintain our
visibility in the graduate job market to help
us attract the best recruits, and we provide
them with high quality early development
opportunities. For the second consecutive
year BP was the highest ranked energy-sector
company in the UK in The Times Top 100
Graduate Employers.
In 2015 46% of our graduate intake were women
and 41% were from outside the UK and US.

Building in-house capability
We provide a broad range of opportunities for our
people – from on-the-job learning and mentoring
programmes through to online and classroombased courses.
We continue to increase our use of technology
in order to provide learning opportunities more
efficiently across the globe, for example,
by launching apps to support on-the-job
development for our graduates and leaders. Our
average expenditure on learning and development
was around $4,000 per person in 2015.
Through our internal academies, we provide
leading technical, functional, compliance and
leadership learning opportunities. We have
six academies, focusing on our operating
management system, petrotechnical skills,
downstream, midstream, leadership, and
functional skills, including finance and legal.

Rewarding performance
We offer a competitive reward package to our
employees based on what they deliver and how
they have demonstrated behaviour reflecting our
values. We evaluate this package on an ongoing
basis and in 2015 we took the decision to freeze
base pay. As part of their performance review,
employees set priorities regarding their
contribution to safety, compliance and risk
management; what they will deliver for the near
and long term; and how they will do their job.
We link the remuneration of our executive team
to strategy and performance. The structure
reflects the long-term nature of our business
and the significance of safety and environmental
risks. Performance measures for pay related to
safety and operational risk include recordable
injury frequency, tier 1 process safety events
and loss of primary containment.

Employee engagement

Diversity and inclusion

Each year we conduct a survey to gather
employees’ views on a wide range of business
topics and identify areas where we can improve.
We track how engaged employees are with our
strategic priorities using our group priorities
index – based on questions about their
perception of BP as a business and how it is
managed in terms of leadership and standards.
This measure fell to 69% in 2015 (2014 72%,
2013 72%).

Our goal is to create an environment of inclusion and
acceptance. For our employees to be motivated and
perform to their full potential, and for the business to
excel, our people need to be treated with respect
and dignity and without discrimination.

Our survey results show a strong increase in
understanding and use of the code of conduct to
guide behaviour and that our employees remain
clear about compliance with safety procedures,
standards and requirements.
However, as expected in the current low oil
price environment, the proportion of employees
responding that they feel more confident about
BP’s future than they did the previous year has
declined. We also saw a decline in scores related
to development and career opportunities.
We understand that employees have concerns
about the consequences of the lower oil price.
We have established additional communications
channels to help address these concerns and
support employees through our restructuring
processes. For example, our executive team
have been holding additional face-to-face town
hall meetings. In our upstream business we have
introduced a dedicated inbox for queries and
regular listening sessions between frontline staff
and management, with a commitment to follow
up on any issues raised.

We continue to make progress in the area of gender
diversity and our aim is for women to represent at
least 25% of group leaders – our most senior
managers – by 2020.
We continue to support the UK government’s
review of gender diversity on boards, undertaken by
Lord Davies in 2011, and maintain an aspiration to
increase female representation to 25%. At the end
of 2015 there were three female directors (2014 2,
2013 2) on our board of 15. Our nomination
committee remains mindful of diversity when
considering potential candidates.
We are also committed to increasing the national
diversity of our workforce to reflect the countries
in which we operate. A total of 23% of our group
leaders came from countries other than the UK and
US at the end of 2015 (2014 22%, 2013 22%).

How we manage risk
We work in a high-hazard industry and risk management is key.

In order to deliver energy to the world safely and
sustainably, we must identify and proactively
manage risks of many forms, from the strategic
and commercial, to the operational.
Our risk management system and policy help us to
identify and assess risks across our business and
manage them at the appropriate level in BP.

Strategic and commercial risk
We look at strategic and commercial risks across
the group, for example climate change,
geopolitical risk and BP’s financial resilience.
Public policies relating to climate change and
carbon pricing could increase costs and reduce
future revenue and strategic growth opportunities
for BP. We are working to help make sure our
business is sustainable – commercially,
environmentally and in a lower-carbon future.
The nature of our business means BP is exposed
to a range of political developments around the
world and subsequent changes to the operating
and regulatory environment. We seek to manage
this risk through our relationships with
governments and stakeholders. In addition,
we closely monitor events and implement risk
mitigation plans where appropriate.
External market conditions can impact our
financial performance. We actively manage this
risk through BP’s diversified portfolio, our financial
framework, regular reviews of market conditions
and our planning and investment processes.

BP’s operating management system

Oversight by the board

Our operating management system (OMS) is
a group-wide framework designed to help us
manage risks in our operating activities and
drive performance improvements.

We identify certain risks as being a high priority
for oversight by the board. For 2016 this includes
financial resilience, geopolitical risk, security,
ethical misconduct, legal and regulatory noncompliance, trading non-compliance, cybersecurity
and incidents associated with the drilling of wells,
operating facilities and the transportation of
hydrocarbons.

OMS brings together BP requirements on
health, safety, security, the environment, social
responsibility and operational reliability, as well as
related issues, such as maintenance, contractor
relations and organizational learning, into a
common management system. It sets out
the rules and principles that govern key risk
management activities such as inspection,
testing, competency development and business
continuity and crisis response planning.

The board delegates some of its oversight
activities to its seven committees. These include
the audit committee, which monitors the
management of financial risk, and the safety,
ethics and environment assurance committee
(SEEAC), which focuses on non-financial risk.

We review and amend our group requirements
within OMS from time to time to reflect BP’s
priorities and experience or changing external
regulations. Any variations in the application of
OMS – in order to meet local regulations or
circumstances – are subject to a governance
process.

SEEAC reviewed reports in 2015 on the risk of
major security incidents, and BP’s management
of risks in marine operations, wells, pipelines and
facilities. Site visits are an important part of
SEEAC’s role, allowing direct interaction with
operating teams. In 2015 they visited sites in the
Netherlands, Oman and Trinidad.

OMS also helps us improve the quality of our
operating activities. All businesses covered
by OMS undertake an annual performance
improvement cycle and assess alignment
with the applicable requirements of the
OMS framework.

The board established a dedicated committee to
monitor geopolitical risk and consider the effect
that heightened political or social tensions or

Operational risk
We prioritize the safety and reliability of our
operations to protect the welfare of our
workforce, the environment and local
communities. Our goal is no accidents, no harm
to people and no damage to the environment.

Continuous improvement at
Castellón refinery – small steps,
great gains

The three lines of defence
Our operating businesses are our first line of
defence. They are responsible for identifying and
managing risks and bringing together people with
the right skills and competencies to do this. They
verify their own conformance with safety and
operating requirements and are also subject to
independent scrutiny and assurance.

BP’s Castellón refinery in Spain can
process a variety of crude oils, with a
capacity of 110 thousand barrels per day.
Since 2009 the refinery has been running
an ongoing programme based on employee
improvement ideas.

The second line of defence is our safety and
operational risk team, which works alongside
operating businesses to set clear requirements;
maintains an independent view of operating risk,
provides assurance on how risks are being
assessed and managed; and intervenes when
appropriate to bring about corrective action.
Our group audit team is the third line of defence,
visiting sites on a risk-prioritized basis, including
third-party drilling rigs, to check how they are
managing risks.

BP Sustainability Report 2015

The programme looks at all aspects of what it
takes to run a refinery. Employees considered
ways to reduce safety risks and operating risks,
improve efficiency and drive employee
motivation. They looked at how to optimize
the refinery’s operations and increase profit
margins. The refinery used the BP continuous
improvement methodology to analyse, prioritize
and implement the ideas.
This approach meant the team could deliver
improvements in many areas, leading to
significant gains overall. In one instance, an
employee suggested changes to a steam line
layout to reduce the possibility of trips or burns.

This is just one example of the 250-plus process
safety and operating risk improvements that
have been made since the programme began.
To date, around 80% of Castellón’s employees
have taken part in the process.
The refinery has also seen that the steps to
improve safety go hand-in-hand with improving
operational reliability. Since the programme
began, there has been steady reduction in tier 1
and 2 process safety events – those events with
the potential to cause the most harm to people
and property. Over the same time, the refinery’s
plant utilization – a measure of how much crude
is being processed – has improved, up from
78% in 2009 to 93% in 2015.

Managing our environmental
and social impacts
We aim to manage environmental and social impacts throughout the
life cycle of our operations – from early project planning to operations
and decommissioning.
We review our management of material issues
such as climate change, water, how we engage
with communities and human rights. This
includes examining emerging risks and actions
taken to mitigate them. We identify areas
for improvement and work to address these
where appropriate.

Project planning

In the early planning stages, we complete a
screening process to identify potential impacts
associated with these projects. These may
include risks to sensitive or internationally
protected areas and water availability. We also
consider social aspects such as prevalence of
corruption and bribery in a host country, local
employment and community health and safety.
We completed this process for five projects
in 2015 (2014 19, 2013 16). This is fewer than
in previous years, primarily due to a reduction
in major projects in line with the low oil price
environment.
Following the screening process, we carry
out impact assessments, identify mitigation
measures and implement these in project
design, construction and operations. For
example, when screening for a drilling project
in Canada, we identified the potential for
cold-water corals in the project area. We plan to
conduct surveys prior to activity to identify the
exact location of the corals and to determine
steps necessary to mitigate potential impacts.

Operations
Our operating sites can have a lifespan of several
decades and our operations are expected to
work to manage environmental and social
impacts throughout.
Every year, our major operating sites review
their environmental performance and set local
improvement objectives. These can include
measures for improving flaring and GHGs, air
quality, or reducing oil spills, waste and impact
on biodiversity. Potential impacts on the
environment vary by site, according to the
location and nature of each operation. We
consider local environmental sensitivities and
their potential impact on nearby communities
in determining which issues require the greatest

As at March 2016 all of our major operations
were in conformance with ISO 14001 with the
exception of recently acquired assets and our

of its activities on the environment in line with
the highly regulated US onshore market.

projects completed our
environmental and social
screening process in 2015.

Our operating sites also have processes to collect
and respond to concerns of local communities.

Decommissioning and remediation
BP works to restore the environment when
remediating or decommissioning a site or in
response to an unplanned incident. When
evaluating and selecting the most appropriate
approach, we take into account environmental
and social considerations, such as potential
energy use and the views of local communities.
For example, we are completing over two
decades of remediation work to enable
redevelopment of our former Paulsboro terminal
in the US as a commercial port, which will
provide jobs and economic opportunities for
the local community and surrounding areas.

Complying with regulations
With operations in more than 70 countries, BP
is subject to diverse and complex environmental
and social laws and regulations. We manage
applicable legal and regulatory health, safety,
security, environmental and social requirements,
through our OMS.

How we operate

Our operating management system (OMS)
includes practices that set out requirements
and guidance for how we identify and manage
environmental and social impacts. The practices
include topics such as our management of
greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), air quality,
workforce welfare and cultural heritage. They
apply to our major projects, projects that involve
new access, those that could affect an
international protected area and some BP
acquisition negotiations.

focus for impact reduction. At a site close
to communities, for example, the immediate
concern may be air quality, whereas a remote
desert site may require greater consideration
of water management issues.

Working with contractors,
suppliers and partners
Like our industry peers, we rarely work in isolation – we need to work
with contractors, suppliers and partners to carry out our operations.
Our ability to be a safe and responsible
operator depends in part on the capability
and performance of those who help us carry
out our operations. We therefore work with
our supply chain on areas such as safety,
operational performance, anti-bribery
and corruption, money laundering and
human rights.

We seek to set clear and consistent
expectations of our contractors. Our standard
model contracts include health, safety,
security and environmental requirements.
Bridging documents are necessary in some
cases to define how our safety management
systems and those of our contractors will
co-exist effectively.

We seek to work with companies that share
our commitment to ethical, safe and sustainable
working practices. We expect and encourage
our contractors and their employees to act in
a way that is consistent with our code of
conduct. And, our operating management
system (OMS) includes requirements and
practices for working with contractors.

Potentially high consequence activity
Contracts involving work that could result
in the most serious risks, according to their
potential impact and probability, demand
our highest scrutiny. Our selection process
for these contractors includes pre-contract
quality, technical and health, safety, security
and environmental audits, that are carried
out on a risk-prioritized basis.

Contractor management
In 2015 52% of the 353 million hours worked
by BP were carried out by contractors (2014
52%, 2013 54%).
We focus on developing deeper, longer-term
relationships with selected contractors. This
helps us to take advantage of economies
of scale and manage risks. We have global
agreements in areas such as equipment,
well services, engineering design and supply
of key retail assets.

We continue to strengthen our process
for working with these contractors in our
upstream business. This includes plans that
address health, safety and environmental
management, contractor self-verification,
BP oversight, key performance measures
and joint performance review meetings.
Sharing experience
We are keen to learn from our contractors and
share our experiences. We hold workshops
with senior executives from BP and our

52%
of the 353 million hours
worked by BP were carried

suppliers to provide opportunities for
engagement. For example, in 2015 we hosted
a forum for our upstream strategic suppliers,
where we discussed how to effectively
collaborate in areas such as operational safety,
increased efficiency in a lower oil price
environment and safe and reliable operations.

How do you confirm that contractors
are working safely and in a way that is
consistent with BP’s standards?
Our role is to oversee and be confident that
our contractors are following the relevant
procedures and management system
requirements. In Upstream, we have
established a robust system for our
third-party contractors who undertake the
most high-risk activity on our behalf. It
allows us to set expectations, oversee
activities and share best practices. As a
result, we have seen a greater sense of
ownership and improved operating
discipline among contractors performing
potentially hazardous activity.
We also meet regularly with the leadership
of our suppliers and contractors to agree
how we can work together to improve
performance. We held two global safety
forums with our upstream contractors in
2015 and I am encouraged by their level of
commitment to take safety to the next
level. While we have taken steps to improve
our operating discipline, roughly 70% of our
operations work is carried out by third-party
contractors. So it is imperative we keep
communication channels open and work
collaboratively with our contractors to drive
rigour and disciplined behaviour in support
of safe and compliant operations.
Fawaz Bitar
Head of global operations
organization, BP

Targeted intervention
Our approach is to work collaboratively with
contractors in a way that seeks to avoid the
need for intervention. Where contractors do
not meet our requirements, they may be put
on a performance improvement plan.
For example, following poor performance
in key areas, we placed an engineering
contractor on a performance improvement
plan until we observed clear improvement.
During this time, we awarded no additional
contract work and met regularly with the
contractor in order to measure progress.
In some instances, we will dismiss contractors
that do not meet our requirements, or are
unable to demonstrate improved performance.

Anti-bribery and corruption
Our code of conduct explicitly prohibits
engaging in bribery and corruption in any form.
Before working with suppliers, we conduct
assessments in order to determine the degree
of bribery and corruption risk they pose and to
carry out checks once contracts are in place.
	See how we work with suppliers on
anti-bribery and corruption on page 21.

We seek to make contractual commitments
with suppliers that encourage them to adhere
to the principles contained in our human rights
policy. Most of our standard model contracts
now include requirements for our suppliers
to respect internationally recognized human
rights in their work for BP.
In some locations, we also conduct social
performance audits, which cover issues such as
forced labour, working hours and conditions and
compensation. Our downstream business
conducted 28 audits in 2015 to assess potential
suppliers as part of our pre-qualification process.

provide additional training opportunities
within an immersive simulation environment.
This allows BP employee and contractor
drilling teams to practice working as an
integrated unit.

Human rights

	Read about how our human rights policy
relates to our suppliers on page 50.

Our joint venture partners
We have a group framework for identifying and
managing BP’s exposure related to safety,
operational, and bribery and corruption risk from
our participation in non-operated joint ventures.
The framework is helping us to assess risks
before making investment decisions and to
monitor these on an ongoing basis.
Around 46% of our upstream production and
13% of our refining capacity in 2015 were from
joint ventures where BP is not the operator.
Typically, our level of influence or control over
a joint venture is linked to the size of our
financial stake. Our OMS applies to the
operations of joint ventures only where we are
the operator. In other cases, one of our joint
venture partners may be the designated
operator. In those cases our OMS does not
apply as the management system to be used
by the operator, but is generally available as
a reference point for BP businesses when
engaging with operators and co-venturers.

Local suppliers
We work with local suppliers where possible,
building the skills of local businesses in order
to further develop the supply chain. In Egypt,
where we have a successful track record
stretching over 50 years, we spent more than
$365 million with local companies in 2015.
	See page 48 for more information on how
we support local suppliers.

Deepwater oil and gas
BP’s expertise and technology are helping to extract
deepwater oil and gas safely and efficiently.
We have deepwater drilling interests in Angola,
Brazil, Egypt, India, Trinidad & Tobago, the UK
and US, and we are pursuing further deepwater
growth opportunities in Australia and Canada.

Safe operating in deep water
Producing oil and gas from deepwater reservoirs
creates engineering and technical challenges –
reservoirs can be 35,000 feet (10,660 metres)
below sea level at high pressure and high
temperature. We use advanced technology
to help us overcome these challenges safely
and responsibly, and run tailored training
programmes to develop the right capability
in our teams.

We use advanced technology to monitor
conditions in our wells, enhance operational
safety and improve drilling efficiency. For
example, BP Well Advisor is a digital monitoring
system that helps people working both offshore
and onshore to view and respond to changes in
well conditions and safety equipment. We use
BP Well Advisor to monitor key areas such as
cementing, pressure testing, and blowout
preventers – devices that are used to seal,
control and monitor oil and gas wells.
We have remote monitoring capabilities in
our Aberdeen, Baku, Houston, Luanda and
Stavanger offices that enable us to oversee
conditions in our offshore wells as needed.
In addition, teams at our monitoring centre
in Houston monitor data from our operated rigs
in the Gulf of Mexico 24 hours a day through
real-time information feeds and video.
Deepwater capability
Our petrotechnical academy offers training
courses in topics such as drilling engineering and
well site leadership. In 2015 we supplemented
our training with Maersk Training’s state-of-theart simulation facilities. The simulators replicate
nearly every critical job on an offshore drilling
rig. BP has started using the facilities to run
customized exercises for offshore drilling teams,
meaning teams made up of employees and
contractors can practice scenarios relevant to
their particular well to enhance operating and
safety performance.

We conduct baseline data collection and ongoing
monitoring of specific deepwater environments
so we can better manage the potential impacts
from our operations, such as disturbance to
sensitive areas or marine habitats. This helps
us in planning drilling activities, laying pipelines
and building offshore platforms, as well as in
responding to oil spills.
In Brazil, where BP has been awarded two
licence blocks in deep water, we worked
with other exploration companies to carry
out an initial marine environmental survey as
required by the regulator. Images of the sea
floor and sediment samples suggested that an
area we had initially earmarked for a logistic
support vessel contained sensitive habitats.
As a result, BP has changed its plans to anchor
in this area. In addition, we commissioned Rio
de Janeiro Federal University and the University
of Florida to perform oil biodegradation
experiments using deepwater samples from
the area. Their findings will inform our decisions
around oil spill response planning.
In Angola we carried out an extensive
environmental monitoring survey around our
offshore blocks, taking over 43,000 man hours
to collect samples from over 150 locations.
This builds on baseline and monitoring surveys
conducted over a decade to meet regulatory
requirements. The survey has further helped
our understanding of the biological conditions
of our deepwater environment. We discovered
underwater features such as deepwater
coral reefs, as well as organisms that produce
energy from methane, in a process a bit like
photosynthesis for a dark environment. The
outcomes enabled us to demonstrate that in our
operated blocks there has been no measurable
impact on the environment since we began
our operations.

on working in marine environments.

“One of our teams was put to the test
shortly after completing the scenariobased simulator training provided by
Maersk Training. They encountered
a high pressure sand while drilling an
exploration well off the coast of Egypt
and dealt with the issue effectively,
closing the well quickly and safely.
There is no doubt in my mind that the
training they completed was a critical
factor in preparing them specifically for
the sorts of challenges they were likely
to encounter drilling this well.”

Our activities

Advanced technology
Enhanced equipment and techniques can
allow safe access to new sources of oil and gas.
For example, together with industry peers, we
are applying expertise developed over many
years to extract oil and gas from high pressure,
high temperature undersea reservoirs that have
previously been beyond the reach of drilling
equipment. We use management and
engineering approaches, such as rigorous
equipment testing, that have proven effective
in a wide range of settings.

Unconventional gas and
hydraulic fracturing
Natural gas plays an increasingly important role in supplying
lower-carbon fuel to meet the world’s growing energy needs.
Natural gas has the lowest greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions of any fossil fuel when burnt.
With the technologies needed to produce and
use this resource widely available today, we
expect that natural gas is likely to meet around
26% of total global energy demand by 2035.
Shale gas is expected to contribute almost half
of the growth in global natural gas supplies
between 2014 and 2035.
BP is working to responsibly develop and
produce natural gas from unconventional
resources including shale gas, tight gas
and coalbed methane. Approximately 80%
of BP’s onshore natural gas production is from
unconventional resources. We have operations
in Oman and the US and we are evaluating
unconventional gas opportunities in other
countries. Our US Lower 48 business spans
5.7 million acres with active operations in
six states.
We work to reduce and manage the impacts
of our operations, including water, chemicals,
GHGs and seismic activity.

Water
BP wells and facilities are designed, constructed,
operated and decommissioned to mitigate the
risk of natural gas and hydraulic fracturing fluids
entering underground aquifers, including drinking
water sources. We test the integrity of our wells
before commencing fracturing and again when
work at the well reaches completion.
We also work to reduce the use of freshwater
in our operations. We are trialling a number
of water-saving innovations, including new
technologies that could make it possible for
us to treat water used in fracturing for reuse in
our operations. At our Khazzan operation in the
remote Omani desert, we treat the wastewater
from our sewage treatment plant and reuse it
for irrigation, landscaping, road construction
and dust suppression. Plans are in place for
2016 to allow us to make multiple uses of
water used in pressure testing.

Chemicals
Water and sand constitute on average 99.5% of
the injection material used in hydraulic fracturing.
Some of the chemicals added to this water-sand
mix, when used in certain concentrations,
are classified as hazardous by the relevant
regulatory authorities. BP works with service
providers to minimize their use where possible.
We list the chemicals we use in the fracturing
process in material safety data sheets at each
site. We also submit data on chemicals used at
our hydraulically fractured wells in the US, to
the extent allowed by our suppliers who own
the chemical formulas at fracfocus.org or other
state-designated websites.
30

BP Sustainability Report 2015

Greenhouse gas emissions
We are working to minimize air pollutant and
GHG emissions, such as methane, at our
operating sites. For example, we use a process
called green completions at our gas operations
in the US. This process captures natural gas
that would otherwise be flared or vented
during the completion and commissioning of
wells. We are also using micro-turbines – lowemission generators – and solar energy to
power our on-site operations.
Our Khazzan gas project in Oman has been
specifically designed to be an inherently low
emission concept. For example, we have built
a central processing facility that takes away
the need for processing equipment at each
individual well site, which can be a source
of additional methane emissions in gas
production.
We have estimated and managed methane and
hydrocarbon emissions from our US onshore
natural gas operations for more than a decade.
	
For more information on GHGs, including
methane, see pages 16 and 42.

Seismic activity
Hydraulic fracturing creates very small earth
tremors that are rarely felt at the surface. The
underground injection of wastewater, such as
for the disposal of water produced from oil and
gas reservoirs, may also pose a risk of inducing
seismic activity in some areas, but very few
events have been documented relative to the
large number of disposal wells in operation.
Before conducting work, BP assesses the
potential risks of induced seismicity resulting
from our operations, and we design our
operations to mitigate this risk. We apply
best practices, reviewing and updating our
approaches to reflect lessons learned across
the industry.

Q&A
What governance process and
standards apply for your Lower 48
business?
Our US Lower 48 onshore business
operates in a highly competitive, regulated
and rapidly changing environment and we
realized we needed an operating model that
could successfully respond and compete
accordingly. Though still wholly owned
by BP, we began operating as a separate
business in 2015 with our own governance,
processes and systems. In practice, this
means that we apply BP’s group operating
management system in a way that is
appropriate to this dynamic environment.
For example, we undertake monthly safety
and operational performance reviews,
which allows us to drive changes in
real-time. And, like all of BP, safety is our
number one priority and measure of
success.
David Lawler
Chief executive officer, US Lower 48
onshore, BP

Engaging with communities
The development of unconventional resources
has moved energy companies into new and
often more densely populated areas. We
seek to mitigate potential impacts on local
communities and address concerns that
may be raised during operations such as
increased traffic, noise, light, dust, air pollution,
visual impacts, disruption of wildlife, and
increased pressures on the local infrastructure.
For example, we work with the Durango
Citizen Advisory Panel, in La Plata County in
Colorado, which meets regularly to discuss
issues of interest to the local community
and BP.

fracturing issue briefing provides more
information on our operations and key
stakeholder issues.

Renewable energy
We operate renewable energy businesses that
complement our core business.
Working in the community
We work to understand both the potential
impacts of our operations in Brazil and the needs
of the local community. Our environmental and
social programmes focus on areas such as road
safety, sustainable sugar cane production and
empowerment of local people.
For example, we have taken steps to increase the
number of women in our agricultural workforce.
Our activities include education and training
in sugar cane cultivation as well as efforts to
open up opportunities for local women in this
predominantly male occupation. We are seeing
positive results, with 325 female agricultural
workers in 2015 (2014 216, 2013 78). This brings
women’s participation up from 2.2% of our
agricultural workforce to 6.8% in two years.

Wind energy

BP currently has the largest operated
renewables business among our oil and
gas peers. Our activities are focused on
biofuels and onshore wind.

Biofuels
Biofuels can be blended into traditional transport
fuels without significant engine modifications or
major changes to existing fuel delivery systems.
Our biofuels business in Brazil produces ethanol
and sugar from sugar cane, and electricity from
sugar cane waste. Following the expansion of our
Tropical mill in 2014, our three sites produced 795
million litres of ethanol equivalent (which includes
ethanol and sugar) in 2015. This represents an
increase of 47%.
We are also investing in the development of
biobutanol, in conjunction with our partner,
DuPont. Compared with other biofuels,
biobutanol can be blended with fuels in higher
proportions, and is easier to transport, store
and manage.
The sustainability of biofuels can vary greatly
depending on the raw materials used and
agricultural conditions. We plan our investments
and run our business to address concerns related
to food security, water, responsibility to the
community and other sustainability impacts.
Our Tropical mill is certified to Bonsucro,
an independent standard for sustainable
sugar cane production, and SA8000, the
international standard for social accountability
and human rights.

Food security and biodiversity
Brazilian sugar cane is one of the most landefficient feedstocks for producing biofuels and
other products. Less than 2% of the land used for
crops or pasture in Brazil is for ethanol production.
BP does not plant sugar cane in priority
conservation areas, focusing instead on
pastureland and areas previously designated for
grain production. Around 20% of our sugar cane
plantation is set aside to protect local biodiversity.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Sugar cane ethanol has life cycle greenhouse gas
emissions that are 70% lower than conventional
transport fuels. In addition, our mills burn bagasse
– the fibre that remains after the sugar cane stalks
have been crushed – to supply energy for the
mills. We also export around 667 gigawatt hours
of green power to the local grid. We estimate
that as a result of our 2015 ethanol production,
approximately 0.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide
(CO2) was avoided, equal to 334,000 fewer
European cars on the road for a year.
Water
Sugar cane cultivation can potentially increase
pressure on water resources. The Goiás region in
Brazil where we operate is especially well suited
to sugar cane agriculture because the rainy and
dry seasons match the needs of the sugar cane’s
growing cycle. The water intensity of our Brazilian
biofuels operations averages around 13 kilograms
of water per kilogram of sugar and ethanol, which
compares favourably to that of many agricultural
food crops within the region.

BP also runs two wind farms on our refinery sites
in the Netherlands, operating on a much smaller
scale, with 32 megawatts of generating capacity,
avoiding around 20,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.
In our US operations, BP follows US Fish and
Wildlife Service guidelines, designed to help
minimize impacts of wind farms on wildlife and
their habitats. We seek to reduce hazards to
wildlife that come into contact with our wind
turbines. For example, we have slowed the
movement of the turbine blades at night during
peak bat-migration season. This blade feathering
reduces bat mortality by as much as 30%.

Our activities

Plant operators at Ituiutaba, one of three BP-operated mills producing ethanol from sugar cane in Brazil.

BP holds interests in 16 onshore wind farms in
the US. Our net generating capacity from this
portfolio, based on our financial stake, is 1,556
megawatts of electricity. This is enough to power
all the homes in a city the size of Dallas. We
calculate that our wind activities helped avoid
around 2.7 million tonnes of CO2 in 2015.

Oil sands
BP is working with our partners to develop Canada’s
oil sands responsibly.
Canada’s oil sands are the third-largest proven
crude oil reserves in the world, after Saudi Arabia
and Venezuela. Oil sands projects can remain
productive for many years – typically 30-50 years
with today’s technology. Working alongside our
partners, we are developing this resource to help
meet the growing demand for energy and ensure
future energy security in a changing world.

Our projects
BP is involved in three oil sands lease areas –
Sunrise, Pike and Terre de Grace – all of which
are located in Alberta.
The Sunrise project, operated by Husky Energy,
began producing oil in early 2015 and is currently
producing approximately 20,000 barrels per day.
Pike, operated by Devon Energy, is at the design
stage. Terre de Grace, which is BP-operated, is
currently under appraisal for future development.
Where we are not the operator of these assets,
we work with our partners to confirm our projects
are planned, overseen, managed and monitored
effectively. All operators are required to meet
or exceed industry practice and regulatory
requirements.
Our decision to invest in Canadian oil sands
projects takes into consideration factors including
commercial viability, impacts on the landscape,
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water use
and local communities.

Commercial viability
BP requires oil sands projects, like all of its
investments, to be commercially viable over the
life of the project. In light of changing global oil
prices, some of our oil sands opportunities remain
under evaluation as we assess the best manner
and timing of development.

Impact on the landscape
Due to the depth at which our oil sands resources
are located, BP and our partners use or plan
to use a production technology called steam
assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). SAGD involves
pumping steam into the oil sand reservoir through
a horizontal well to heat the oil, which is then
extracted through a second, lower horizontal well.
This process results in less land disturbance than
mining as the operations have a smaller physical
footprint and do not require tailings ponds.
Alongside our partners, we work to promote the
regeneration of habitat after the completion of our
activities. This includes tree planting, landscape
assessments and erosion control. In 2015 we
planted approximately 12,000 trees at Terre de
Grace, which will help to restore the landscape
following our exploration programme.

Greenhouse gas emissions

Local communities

In ‘well-to-wheels’ studies – which measure
GHG emissions from producing the oil (well)
through to combustion (wheels), crude produced
from oil sands applying SAGD technology is
around 8% more GHG intensive than the average
crude refined in the US. We are working with
our partners to reduce emissions and continue
to meet the comprehensive and rigorous
regulatory requirements.

BP recognizes that some aboriginal communities
living near Alberta’s oil sands region are
concerned about the potential impacts of oil
sands development. We engage with local
communities, including neighbouring First Nations
and Métis, on activities relating to the Terre de
Grace lease. We work to maintain relationships
with local communities through regular meetings,
field site visits – including those by our board
committee for sustainability issues – and support
for local community events.

We are working to deliver improvements through
heat integration and recovery techniques in our
processing facilities. These allow us to use energy
that would otherwise be lost into the atmosphere,
for example to improve our operational
performance or heat buildings on site. We are
exploring new high-efficiency boiler options along
with lower-carbon fuel alternatives. We also aim
to reduce energy use at well sites through the
use of insulated tubing and electric submersible
pumps. We encourage our partners to use the
best available energy efficient technologies in the
design of plant and field facilities.

Water
Water supply and management are key elements
in planning a SAGD project. BP is committed to
maintaining a high level of water conservation and
our oil sands projects are designed to meet or
exceed regulatory requirements. At Sunrise, the
water used to make steam is primarily recycled
from the wells. Where additional water is
required, this is recycled from other operators
in the area or drawn from deep underground
aquifers that are not suitable for human
consumption. Any water that cannot be recycled
is injected into a deep disposal well, isolated from
drinking water aquifers.

The Arctic
We operate nine onshore fields in Alaska. Our offshore interests
in the Arctic are currently limited to areas for exploration.

In Alaska temperatures can fall below freezing for
more than nine months of the year. We enclose
our facilities to continue operating safely in these
harsh weather conditions.

Our working interests
BP has operated in the US Arctic for several
decades, opening our first office in Alaska in
1959. We operate nine onshore fields on
Alaska’s North Slope.
In the offshore Arctic, BP has a largely nonoperated position. We have investments in areas
including the Barents Sea, Greenland and the
Canadian Beaufort. We continue to assess
opportunities, proceeding only where we believe
it makes commercial sense and we understand
and can manage associated risks and impacts.
We have decided with our partner and operator,
Imperial Oil, to defer the proposed Beaufort Sea
exploration drilling programme. The joint venture,
in which we hold a 50% non-operating position,
will continue to maintain a presence in the
Beaufort, conducting a multi-year programme
to collect critical ice data and continuing to work
with local communities to define business,
employment and training opportunities.
Rosneft
We hold a 19.75% share in Rosneft, Russia’s
largest oil company, and remain committed to
our strategic investment while complying with
all relevant sanctions. BP does not currently
have operations in the offshore Russian Arctic
or directly partner with Rosneft on any of its
offshore Arctic licences.

Working safely
Our operations in Alaska have governmentapproved land, air and water use permits and oil
spill response plans that consider the sensitivity

of the Arctic. We share our knowledge and
experience in the Arctic with our partners to help
deliver safe and responsible operations in this
sensitive environment. For example, we are
working with new North Slope operators to
share our experience in pipeline inspection
and management.
We are also working with others in the oil and
gas industry to develop consistent operating
standards for the Arctic that address areas such
as the working environment, environmental
monitoring, ice management and Arctic offshore
structures. We worked with the International
Maritime Organization (IMO) to develop an
international code of safety for ships operating
in polar waters and we are also contributing to
the development of IMO safety guidance on
operational limitations in ice.

55+
years working in
the US onshore Arctic.

Understanding the Arctic
environment
We have been studying the environment on
Alaska’s North Slope since before start-up of the
Prudhoe Bay oil field in 1977. We continue to
support research to further understand polar bear
behaviour. And, we support long-term monitoring
of nesting birds on the tundra to gain a better
understanding of potential impacts from industry,
climate change and predators.

Working with local communities
Arctic communities depend on the natural
environment for their livelihoods and cultural
heritage. We acknowledge the importance of
respecting their unique cultures and ways of life.
We also recognize that local knowledge and
experience can enhance our operating approach.
For example, through our work with the North
Slope community, we use a technique for grass
replacement, where appropriate, that allows for
quicker revegetation of disturbed tundra.

Our activities

The Arctic offers opportunities to help meet the
world’s growing energy needs, but there are also
specific challenges due to its unique nature.
These challenges range from environmental,
social and political, to operational, technological
and commercial.

Safety
Everything we do depends on the safety
of our operations, our workforce and the
communities around us. We strive to
create and maintain a safe operating
culture, putting safety front and centre
of everything we do.

Andrew platform in the North Sea, UK. The platform has
recently been refurbished to improve its integrity and
operational efficiency as part of a larger project aiming
to extend its productive life by a decade.

Preventing incidents through
process safety
Major accidents or spills are infrequent, but can result in
serious harm to people and the environment.
Process safety is the application of good design
and engineering principles, as well as robust
operating and maintenance practices, to
avoid accidents. Our approach builds on our
experience, including learning from incidents,
operations audits, annual risk reviews and
sharing lessons learned with our industry peers.

to investigate incidents, capture learnings and
track leading indicators. This regular review
has contributed to improvements across a
number of leading process safety metrics,
helping the plant manage its operations within
safe operating and design limits. Operating
reliability has also gone up by 14% since 2013.

A proactive approach

Our performance

We undertake process safety reviews to
identify hazards, assess risks and define risk
reduction measures to prevent accidents from
happening. We focus on managing the highest
priority risks associated with our operations,
targeting our efforts at keeping our products
safely within pipes and containers. For
example, following a review at our Rotterdam
refinery in the Netherlands, we installed
high-level alarms that sound when storage
tanks are close to exceeding safe operating
limits, and automatic cut-out systems to
prevent them spilling over.

We track the number of process safety events
occurring across our upstream facilities and
downstream plants. This includes unplanned
or uncontrolled releases of materials causing
harm to people or the environment, damage to
equipment or exceeding threshold quantities.

A learning organization

Analysing performance data and learning from
incidents are just as important at a local level.
Our Merak petrochemicals plant in Indonesia
established a formal weekly process in 2013

Self-verification – there’s an app
for that!
A BP-commissioned app loaded onto tablet
computers is helping our global wells organization
monitor and improve operating discipline,
reducing safety incidents related to incorrect
following of procedures.
Experience tells us that one of the most effective
ways to drive down operational risk is to
systematically check that the work being carried
out at our sites is in accordance with the relevant
management systems – this is self-verification.
Getting these checks right on drilling rigs, where
teams switch in and out with shift rotations and
around 80% of the workforce is made up of
contractors, is paramount.

We have seen improvements in our process
safety performance over the past five years.
This has been true across our upstream and
downstream businesses, with fewer tier 1
process safety events, fewer leaks and spills
and fewer recordable injuries. At the same
time, the reliability of our rigs and refineries has
improved. We believe this shows that the rigour
needed to produce safe operations tends also
to produce reliable operations. We will maintain
our focus on systematic safety management,
including self-verification and testing the
effectiveness of our risk mitigation measures.

Tier 1 process safety events – as defined by the American
Petroleum Institute in RP-754 – are losses of primary
containment causing harm to a member of the workforce,
costly damage to equipment or exceeding defined
quantities. Tier 2 events are those of lesser consequence.
Our figures for loss of primary containment in 2014 and
2015 include increased reporting due to the introduction
of enhanced automated monitoring for remote sites in our
US Lower 48 business. Using a like-for-like approach with
prior years’ reporting, our 2015 loss of primary containment
figure is 208 (2014 246).

Safety

We analyse performance data and assurance
insights to help us understand how well our
systems are working, map early trends, and
ultimately get a better understanding of our
key safety risks. This means we can target
our process safety improvement efforts
appropriately. For example, when we found
that control of work was a contributing factor
to process safety near misses in our upstream
business, we carried out training sessions in the
correct application of safety procedures to seek
to address this.

We also track loss of primary containment,
which includes unplanned or uncontrolled
releases of our products from pipes, containers
or vehicles within our operational boundary,
excluding releases of non-hazardous substances
such as water. We seek to record all losses of
primary containment regardless of the volume
of the release, and to report externally on losses
over a certain severity threshold.

Process safety events
(number of incidents)

Well site leaders use the app, ‘eWells’, to record
and share inspection data. They must log in on a
weekly basis to confirm that they have read and
understood new safety alerts, and undertaken
required follow-up actions. The resulting
information is uploaded automatically to a central
database, meaning safety and operational risk
experts can review the information without delay
and share any significant findings directly with
rigs and well sites around the world.
The app has been cited as a contributing factor
to the marked reduction in safety incidents we
have seen since its introduction, including a 33%
reduction in dropped object incidents across
our wells operations in 2015. Data from the
app serves to help our sites identify potential
weaknesses in our operating approach and
informs risk, performance and planning reviews.
BP Sustainability Report 2015

Drilling safety
Safe, efficient and reliable drilling operations are critical to the
delivery of our upstream activities.
Our global wells organization manages BP wells
operations around the world, whether in deep
water or onshore. The centralized team is
responsible for the drilling practices underpinning
our efforts to prevent incidents throughout the life
of a well and mitigate impacts should they occur.
It is also responsible for developing the right skills
and competencies in the workforce.

Advanced technology
Technological innovation has enabled safe and
reliable operations even as the industry has moved
into deeper water and new, more complex
geologies. We use technology to monitor
conditions over the lifetime of our wells. For
example, we have piloted the use of fibre-optic
sensing technology to detect integrity problems
and sand movement within our wells, which can
cause leaks, blockages and corrosion. As a result
of preliminary surveys at our Valhall platform in the
North Sea, we will be able to use this technology
to help us identify blockages and assess any
damage in a given well, including the type of
damage and where it is located. This will help us
plan maintenance and decommissioning work.
	
See page 29 for more information on
deepwater oil and gas.

Working with industry peers
We share expertise and work to promote common
standards across the industry. For example, in
2015 we worked with industry peers to publish
global definitions of well control incidents,
providing a common way to report and share
lessons learned. We also continued our work
with other organizations to develop joint industry
standards in areas such as subsea well control
equipment and high pressure, high temperature
and subsea drilling equipment.

Completing the Bly Report
recommendations
We have completed all 26 recommendations
made by BP’s investigation into the Deepwater
Horizon accident, the Bly Report. In doing so,

Gulf of Mexico:
Independent monitors
Two independent monitors – an ethics monitor
and a process safety monitor – were appointed
under the terms of the criminal plea agreement
BP reached with the US government in 2012.
Under the terms of the agreement, we are
taking additional actions, enforceable by the
court, to further enhance ethics and compliance
across BP and the safety of its drilling
operations in the Gulf of Mexico.

36

BP Sustainability Report 2015

we have acted to enhance blowout-preventer
reliability, well control, well integrity and
cementing, verification and risk management,
drilling capability and training. The programme
has involved significant work both within BP
and with our service providers and contractors:
developing new standards and enhancing
existing standards, carrying out hundreds of
audits, site visits to our drilling locations around
the world, and training over 3,000 individuals
during more than 130 workshop sessions.
Independent assessment
The BP board appointed Carl Sandlin as
independent expert in 2012 to provide an
objective assessment of BP’s global progress
in implementing the recommendations from the
Bly Report. He also provided process safety
observations and his views on the organizational
effectiveness and culture of the global wells
organization.
Over the period of his appointment, Mr Sandlin
met regularly with board members and wells
organization leadership and reviewed the
standards and practices developed to complete
the recommendations. He made three visits to
each of the regional wells teams with active
drilling operations, meeting key personnel and
drilling contractors on site.

Q&A
How have the Bly recommendations made
your drilling operations safer, and how do
you maintain this?
Completing the Bly Report recommendations
has been a huge undertaking for BP and has
led to fundamental change in how we manage
risk in our drilling operations. Now we’re
working hard to make sure our new and
enhanced practices and procedures are
understood and adhered to. We’ve invested in
our people – so they have the right capabilities
and work in a systematic fashion, regularly
checking their own work.

Mr Sandlin’s engagement came to a close
in February 2016 after he reported to the
board’s safety, ethics and environment
assurance committee that all 26 Bly Report
recommendations had been closed out to his
satisfaction. He stated that the idea of safety as
a top priority is firmly ingrained throughout the
global wells organization and noted an increase
in the degree of rigour and engagement at
all levels. He recommended the organization
build on the foundations established by the
recommendations and maintain its focus on
continuous improvement in the areas of safety
culture, self-verification and training.

But there is always more we can do. In the
spirit of continuous improvement, we carry
on challenging and improving what we do.

The ethics monitor delivered an initial report
early in 2015. He delivered a second report later
in the year under a separate administrative
agreement with the US Environmental
Protection Agency. Recommendations from the
two reports largely relate to BP’s ethics and
compliance programme and code of conduct,
including its implementation and enforcement.
The recommendations have been consolidated
and agreed, and BP is now in the process of
implementing them. The ethics monitor is
meanwhile conducting a follow-up review as
the next phase of his engagement.

The process safety monitor reviews and
provides recommendations concerning BP
Exploration & Production Inc’s (BPXP) process
safety and risk management procedures for
deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. BPXP
is the BP group company that conducts
exploration and production operations in the
Gulf of Mexico. The process safety monitor
also submitted a report in 2015. Following
discussions between BPXP, the process safety
monitor and the US Department of Justice, the
recommendations have now been finalized and
implementation by BPXP is underway.

I’m proud of the commitment I see
demonstrated by our drilling personnel,
which is keeping this momentum going.
The recommendations, now complete, live
on as part of our operating management
system, helping us deliver safe, reliable
and competitive wells.

Security and crisis management
The scale and spread of our operations means we must prepare for
a range of possible business disruptions and emergency events.
Potential threats to our business are not always
predictable and come in many forms, such as
earthquakes, extreme weather, hostile physical
or cyber attacks, political conflicts, health alerts
and major accidents. We have processes in
place to try to anticipate them and to be ready
if a crisis or incident occurs.

Security management
BP monitors for, and aims to guard against,
hostile actions that could cause harm to our
people or disrupt our operations, including
physical and digital threats and vulnerabilities.
We assess risk on an ongoing basis in those
operating regions that are affected by political
and social unrest, terrorism, armed conflict or
criminal activity. Our central security team
provides guidance and support to our
businesses through a network of regional
security advisers. We continue to monitor
threats globally and, in particular, the situation
in the Middle East and North Africa.

BP is a signatory to the Voluntary Principles on
Security and Human Rights, which are designed
to help companies maintain security while
promoting respect for human rights.
	
See page 50 for more information on
security and human rights.

Cyber attacks present a risk to the security of
our information, IT systems and operations.
We collaborate closely with governments, law
enforcement agencies and industry peers to
understand and respond to new and emerging
cyber threats. We also monitor our IT systems
for suspicious activity and have a 24-hour
monitoring centre in the US tasked with this.
We promote good cybersecurity behaviours
in our workforce through easy-to-understand
policies and instructional videos. Campaigns and
presentations on topics such as email phishing
and protecting our information and equipment
have helped to raise employee awareness of
these issues.

Crisis management
Crisis and continuity management planning
helps us keep our people safe, respond
effectively to emergencies and avoid potentially
severe disruptions in our operations. In addition
to carrying out routine monitoring and an annual
risk assessment process, our businesses are
expected to carry out exercises at both a local
and regional level to test their preparedness
to respond.
For example, in 2015 we carried out a two-day
oil spill response exercise involving a drilling rig
in the UK North Sea. The exercise involved more
than 150 people from across our North Sea
business as well as relevant government
agencies. It gave those responsible for oil spill
response from different teams within the region
the opportunity to test joint oil spill preparedness
plans, supported by coaching from BP’s central
response team.

Q&A
How big a risk is cybersecurity for BP?
News headlines frequently contain reports
of cyber attacks stealing huge volumes
of information or, increasingly, causing
damage and disrupting business operations.
These events have demonstrated how
quickly systems once believed to be secure,
can become vulnerable. This complex,
fast-changing landscape, and BP’s reliance
on technology, mean that cybersecurity is a
risk BP takes very seriously. Cybersecurity
is one of the company’s highest level risks
and is monitored by the board. We take an
intelligence-led approach to evolve our
cyber defences and response, in line with
the fast-changing threats.

Safety

Following the armed terrorist attack on the
In Amenas gas plant in Algeria in 2013, BP and
Statoil continue to work with Sonatrach, the
Algerian state oil and gas company, and the
Algerian authorities on a programme of further
enhancements to the joint venture’s security
systems and assurance of their ongoing
effectiveness.

Health and personal safety
We strive to create and maintain safe and healthy
working environments.

Our golden rules for safety focus on areas such
as working at height, lifting operations and
driving safety.

We are committed to keeping people safe,
whether they are working on our sites or living
in communities near our operations.

Personal safety
Each member of the workforce has an obligation
and the authority to stop unsafe work. We provide
our operations personnel with training on
identifying hazards and addressing risks associated
with tasks. We have ‘golden rules’ aligned to our
operating management system that guide our
workers on staying safe in situations with the
potential to cause most harm. Although the rate
of serious personal safety incidents has declined
since BP originally introduced the rules in 2003,
we have updated them to signal their continued
importance in these high-risk areas.
Creating the right safety culture at our sites is
important. It takes strong leadership and an active
commitment to safe operating from all members
of the workforce. For example, our Frontignan fuel
terminal in France passed a milestone in 2015 of
four years without a single day away from work
case. They achieved this by focusing on good
practice in contractor management, tightening
up on adherence to safety procedures, and clear,
consistent communication from management
about the duty to stop unsafe work.

Our performance
We monitor and report on key workforce personal
safety metrics and include both employees and
contractors in our data. In 2015 BP reported one
workforce fatality in Turkey that occurred when a
ceiling collapsed during renovations at a recently
acquired retail site. We are saddened by this death
and continue to dedicate ourselves to eliminating
injuries and fatalities in our work.
We measure our workforce recordable injury
frequency, which is the number of reported
work-related incidents that result in a fatality
or injury (apart from minor first aid cases) per
200,000 hours worked. We also measure our
38

BP Sustainability Report 2015

day away from work case frequency, which is the
number of incidents per 200,000 hours worked
that resulted in an injury where a person is unable
to work for a day (shift) or more.
Both our recordable injury frequency and our
workforce day away from work case frequency
improved in 2015. Although this is encouraging,
we continue to focus our efforts on safety to
reduce incidents.

Health and wellbeing
We aim to manage occupational risks and reduce
exposure to hazardous substances. As part of this,
we have piloted a new process to recommend
internal occupational exposure limits for
substances such as hydrogen sulphide. We plan
to extend this to other priority substances in 2016.
Our health programmes consider global concerns,
such as the possibility of an influenza pandemic or
a disease like ebola. We also have programmes
around the world to help improve the health of
communities in which we operate.
We run programmes to promote healthy lifestyles,
such as online training modules on fatigue, stress,
office ergonomics and travel health. Our fatigue
module, which has been viewed 20,000 times,
offers strategies to improve sleep quality and
combat tiredness, warning of the impacts fatigue
can have on both health and work outcomes.

Product stewardship
We aim to manage our products throughout their
life cycle to meet customer and legal expectations
and intended performance.
We assess our products to identify any potential
health, safety or environmental aspects and to
verify compliance with chemical control, product
safety and hazard communication regulations,
monitoring developments in regulation globally.
We work with industry, government, and others
to advance knowledge about the safe use of
our products.

Transportation safety
We work to safely transport our people and equipment
to our sites, and fuel to our customers.
BP is a global business with operations in remote
locations so safe transportation of our people and
products is an important focus area for us.

Driving safety
Driving safety is a priority because vehicle-related
incidents remain one of the key risks facing our
industry. In 2015 alone, BP employees and
contractors drove nearly 600 million kilometres,
which is the equivalent of 15,000 journeys around
the world. Transporting fuel from refineries to
service stations, and other downstream activities,
account for most of these kilometres.
We rely on a variety of metrics to monitor our
driving safety performance. For example, we track
our severe vehicle accident rate, which includes
accidents that result in death, injury, a spill, a
vehicle rollover or serious vehicle damage. We also
track our total vehicle accident rate, which is the
sum of all on-road and off-road motor vehicle
accidents per million kilometres driven. In 2015
there were 637 reported vehicle accidents, and
four third-party fatalities.
We provide guidance on road safety, including
what constitutes a fit-for-purpose vehicle and the
need to wear a seatbelt. We tailor our programmes
to the local context and where possible we work to
extend the reach of BP programmes to local
communities.

Rail safety
Our sites receive oil and gas products delivered by
rail using both BP-owned or leased and third-party
rail cars. Much of this is in the US where our use of
railways has increased following our modernization
project at Whiting refinery and the construction of
a new rail terminal at our Cherry Point refinery. For
example, at Cherry Point we receive on average
45 thousand barrels of crude oil by rail per day.
Our railcars have enhanced safety features such as
insulation to protect cargo in the event of a fire, and
a protective shell to defend against puncturing and
resulting spills or releases.

Aviation safety
We use a variety of aircraft, often in challenging
conditions. Our safety requirements cover the
approval of aviation operators, contracting for
aviation services, and the safe management of
any aircraft operated on behalf of BP.
There have been a number of incidents involving
helicopters in the North Sea over the past few
years. Oil and gas companies, helicopter suppliers
and regulators have collectively analysed these
events and as a result, the oil and gas industry is
using enhanced emergency breathing systems
for offshore helicopter passengers in the UK
and is evaluating plans for a wider roll out of
these systems.

Preparing to transport our people to work a shift on Andrew platform in the UK North Sea.

We have entered into aircraft sharing agreements
in the Gulf of Mexico, Norway and Trinidad &
Tobago in an effort to reduce the number of aircraft
and flights required. We are continuing to explore
similar types of arrangements in other geographic
areas where this strategy could be implemented.

Shipping safety
We transport our products across oceans,
around coastlines and along waterways, using
a combination of BP-operated and chartered
vessels. All are subject to our health, safety,
security and environmental requirements.
To help avoid major spills, all ships in our managed
international fleet are double-hulled. We continue
to invest in our fleet, for example, 28 deep sea oil
tankers and six LNG tankers are on order and
planned for delivery into the BP-operated fleet
between 2016 and 2019. We have marine
assurance requirements for all oil and gas transport
vessels that we hire for specific periods or voyages.
BP seeks to avoid known areas of pirate attack or
armed robbery. Where this is not possible, we will
continue to transit vessels through these areas,
adopting heightened security measures.

Safety

We share lessons learned from incidents globally
and we have seen a significant decline over the
past 10 years in the number of vehicle-related
fatalities associated with our work. However, two
countries where we have seen workforce and
third-party fatalities over the past five years are
Brazil and South Africa. We have been using
in-vehicle camera technology to record potentially

risky driving behaviours and using the video clips
as a coaching aid to improve driving technique.
Drivers in our lubricants business in South Africa
managed on average to halve the number of video
clips requiring coaching in the month following
their first intervention, with a consistent decline
in the months that followed.

environmental issues for our business such
as greenhouse gas emissions, air quality,
water use and sensitive areas.

In Colorado in the US we are deploying smaller rigs to

Oil spill preparedness and
response
We are working to continuously improve how we control,
contain and clean up oil spills should they occur.
Though our priority is to prevent oil spills, they can
still happen. We take steps to improve our ability
to respond to spills, including through simulation
exercises, using technology to enhance our
response capability and updating our oil spill
response plans. Our performance over time
suggests that our focus on response plans and
spill exercises have helped improve our ability
to respond to oil spill events.

New and emerging technologies

Oil spill response exercises

We are working to incorporate a common
operating picture – a single picture of all response
related activity and resources at a given moment
in time – into any BP oil spill response scenario.
We use a tool that gathers multiple layers of
geospatial data to create an integrated picture,
which includes information on infrastructure,
vessels, environment, incident features, weather
and climate data, and predictive modelling. This
helps us to better co-ordinate and manage our
resources and improve real-time decision making
for a more efficient and effective response.

We regularly conduct oil spill exercises at
locations around the world. For example, we
worked with state and federal regulators in the
Gulf of Mexico to assess the ability to treat or
remove oil using dispersant, in-situ burning and
mechanical means. We also tested the ability to
maintain a cohesive response should the team
command physically move from one facility to
another during a response, which is often done
to work more closely with federal, state and local
government officials.
In Alaska nearly 400 participants, including
federal and state government and industry
representatives, took part in a two-day exercise
hosted by BP. The exercise tested the time taken
to bring equipment and vessels from outside the
immediate area, as well as working in changing
weather conditions, and the transition of roles
and responsibilities during the response.
We also worked with government authorities,
local administrators, fishing communities and our
industry peers as part of a shoreline exercise in
Angola. We were responsible for the practical
deployment of some of our shoreline and
on-water equipment and having a number of
observers present. The exercise demonstrated
that both BP and the sharing of regional response
resources continue to improve.

In October 2015 settlement agreements were
filed with the federal court in New Orleans to
resolve all US federal and state government
claims arising from the Deepwater Horizon
accident and spill. The $18.7 billion settlement
includes over $7 billion to address claims for
natural resource damages. This is the largest
single element of the settlement and is in
addition to the $1 billion already committed for
early restoration. The settlement is pending final
court approval.

Incorporating learnings
Our requirements for oil spill preparedness and
response planning incorporate what we have
learned over many years of operation.
We updated our oil spill response plan
requirements in 2012 to incorporate learnings
from the Deepwater Horizon accident. Revised
response plans include elements such as
specialized modelling techniques to help predict
the impact of potential spills, provision of
stockpiles of dispersant and use of technologies
like aerial and underwater robotic vehicles for
environmental monitoring. This is a substantial
piece of work and our operating businesses with
the potential to spill oil are on track to complete
updates by the end of 2016.
how wildlife populations and the environment
may have been affected by the 2010 Deepwater
Horizon accident and oil spill. Some of the study
data informed the draft assessment of injury to
natural resources in the Gulf of Mexico that was
prepared by federal and state trustees (NRD
Trustees). BP had no role in developing the draft
assessment or accompanying restoration plan.
In addition to the settlement agreement, BP
has agreed to provide $37 million to the federal
government to develop a publicly available
Gulf of Mexico environmental data
management system.
Early restoration projects
As at December 2015 BP and the NRD Trustees
have agreed on 64 early restoration projects
that are expected to cost approximately $832
million; BP has funded $762 million to date.

lessons learned in our drilling operations.
See page 37 for more information on our
approach to crisis management.
Work includes efforts to restore and enhance
wildlife, habitats and the services provided by
those habitats.
Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative
In 2010 BP committed to pay $500 million over
10 years to support independent research to
improve society’s ability to understand, respond
to and mitigate the potential impacts of oil spills
on marine and coastal ecosystems.
As at the end of 2015 the Gulf of Mexico
Research Initiative had awarded approximately
$391 million in grants for research in areas
including the ecological and human health
aspects of spills, and the development of new
technology for future spill response, mitigation
and restoration. View the research projects at

Gulf of Mexico:
Environmental restoration

We investigate and test the applicability of
emerging technologies into our oil spill response
capability. For example, in the Middle East, we
have trialled the use of satellite imagery as a way
to monitor for potential oil spills over large land
areas and track clean-up response time.

Greenhouse gases and
other air emissions
We manage our emissions through energy efficiency, reductions
in flaring, methane management and the design of new projects.

We take a holistic approach to our GHG
management by tracking and understanding our
CO2 and methane emissions. We recognize the
short-term warming effects of methane, the
long-term effects of CO2, and their combined
role in climate change.
GHG regulation is increasing globally with a focus
on reducing flaring and methane emissions in
many jurisdictions. We expect that GHG regulation
will continue to have an impact on our businesses,
operating costs and strategic planning, but may
also offer opportunities for the development of
lower-carbon technologies and businesses.
A variety of factors – such as shifts in business
activity, production or assets – can influence a
company’s GHG emissions. This makes it difficult
to establish an appropriate GHG target that can be
cascaded throughout the organization with the
objective of achieving cost-effective emission
reductions. For these reasons, BP, like some of our
peers, does not set enterprise-wide GHG targets.

Our performance
We report GHG emissions from all BP’s consolidated
entities as well as our share of equity-accounted
entities other than BP’s share of Rosneft.
Our direct GHG emissions were 48.9 million
tonnes (Mte) in 2015 (2014 48.6Mte, 2013
50.3Mte). The increase in our reported
emissions is due to updating the global warming
potential for methane. Without this update,
our emissions would have decreased primarily
due to divestments in Alaska.
42

BP Sustainability Report 2015

Through our participation in the Oil and Gas
Climate Initiative we are working to improve the
understanding and reliability of methane data. This
will help to better prioritize mitigation measures.

Flaring
Flaring is the controlled burning of natural gas
found in oil and gas reservoirs, or the controlled
burning of waste gas in production, refining and
manufacturing operations. It is necessary in
the initial commissioning of a well, during the
start-up of operations, as a safety release or
during maintenance.
BP is a founding member of the World Bank’s
Global Gas Flaring Reduction partnership, a
public-private partnership that supports the
development of infrastructure and regulatory
mechanisms to help use gas that would otherwise
be vented or flared during oil and gas operations.
In 2015 BP joined the World Bank Zero Routine
Flaring by 2030 initiative, which aims to eliminate
routine flaring from oil assets by the year 2030.
We are evaluating our existing operations to
identify possible reduction opportunities. Our
major new projects include design requirements
that already meet the initiative objectives.
Our operations seek to minimize flaring,
wherever practical. Some of our sites, for
example in Alaska, re-inject gas into the
reservoir to enhance production.
Working with regional partners in Azerbaijan, we
made improvements to our offshore infrastructure

The Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC)
is committed to reducing short-lived climate
pollutants. We joined the CCAC’s Oil and Gas
Methane Partnership in 2015, which aims to
reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas
sector. As part of this voluntary initiative,
participating companies analyse sources of
methane to evaluate cost-effective technologies
for methane emissions reduction.

Operational
changes

We recognize the role GHGs play in climate change
and aim to manage our GHG emissions through
operational energy efficiency, reductions in flaring
and venting, and by factoring a carbon cost into our
investment appraisals and the engineering design
of new projects. We also participate in global GHG
reduction initiatives. We review our emissions and
assess possible mitigation measures at a companywide level, and provide guidance to our businesses
to manage emissions in line with applicable local
requirements.

Methane has a strong warming effect on the
climate, but a relatively short lifetime in the
atmosphere. We manage these emissions at a
local level and take actions to control them, such
as capturing gas that would otherwise be vented,
and installing new equipment that uses
compressed air rather than natural gas.

We look at our GHG performance in a variety of
different ways. We review the year-on-year
change in our total GHG emissions, our GHG
emissions by business activity as well as our
most significant climate change pollutants.

Acquisitions

	Read about our low-carbon efforts – gas,
renewable energy, efficient operations
and products, and research – on page 16.

Each year since 2002 we have estimated the
reduction in our reported annual GHG emissions
due to efficiency projects – those not driven by
regulatory requirements. These projects include
reductions in flaring and venting, as well as energy
efficiency projects, such as process optimization
and waste-heat recovery. By the end of 2015 the
running total of these real sustainable reductions
exceeded 8.8Mte.

Update of global
warming potential

Oil and natural gas companies generate
greenhouse gases (GHGs) in almost every aspect
of their work, from the finding, extracting and
processing of hydrocarbon resources, to the
transforming and delivery of these resources to
customers. During these processes, the most
significant GHG emissions, including carbon
dioxide (CO2) and methane, come from the
combustion of fossil fuels for energy, the flaring
and venting of gas, and losses from equipment.

operations in several sites in Azerbaijan, Georgia
and Turkey, and the North Sea.

GHG intensity
For each of our major business activities,
we track GHG intensity, which is the
quantity of GHG emitted in tonnes per
a defined unit of measurement.

“Methane emissions are important to
understand, and even more important
to control, in order to reduce their
impact on climate change and to
maximize the life cycle greenhouse
gas advantages of natural gas. At BP,
we’ve taken significant steps to
understand the methane emissions
from our upstream operations. For
example, we have years of experience
studying and improving the emissions
performance of our onshore Lower 48
assets and have just completed
detailed baseline surveys of our other
operated facilities. These surveys will
help to identify potential reduction
opportunities.

to reduce flaring by either re-injecting associated
gas back into the reservoir, or collecting and selling
it. As a result of our efforts, the volume of gas
flared has halved since 2010, and 265 thousand
tonnes (kte) of CO2 equivalent is avoided annually.
In Indonesia, we have been working on a
long-term flare reduction programme. Since 2010
our Tangguh operations have reduced flaring by
87% by recycling gas for use as a fuel and
continuous improvement in controlling sources.
We have seen a 15% decrease in flaring in our
upstream operations since 2014, primarily due to
improvements made to the gas injection

We expect the GHG intensity of our refining
portfolio to remain relatively flat or to decrease
at certain refineries due to efficiency projects
in progress.
The decrease in GHG intensity of our
petrochemicals portfolio reflects ongoing
efficiency gains in our aromatics and acetyls
businesses.

Energy efficiency
We look for ways to make our operations more
energy efficient by reducing the amount of
energy we need to produce our products. For
example, our LNG operations in Tangguh are
designed to be highly energy efficient through
the use of combined cycle gas turbines and
recycled waste-heat.

Air quality
Some of our activities, such as burning fossil
fuels for power generation and operating our
shipping fleet, emit or contribute to pollutants
of sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and ozone.
These pollutants may result in the formation
of smoke, dust or smog, and can present a risk
to human health. We seek to manage these
emissions to meet accepted standards and
guidelines designed to protect the environment
and the health of local communities.
We are working with an air monitoring
manufacturer and academia to pilot portable,
real-time, air monitoring technology. The
technology is designed to measure nitrogen
oxides, sulphur oxides and ground level ozone
in different climates and physical environments.
This air quality data will provide a more
comprehensive understanding of the impact
of our emissions and will allow for more
effective management.

Environment

Through our participation in the
Climate and Clean Air Coalition
methane initiative, we will be able to
share our knowledge and experience
in the onshore US, and benefit from
the learnings of our peers. The
initiative provides the opportunity
for the industry, government and
non-government organizations to
work together to develop a common
understanding of methane emissions
and practical ways to minimize them.”

The increased GHG intensity in our upstream
operations over the past few years reflects our
divestment of lower-intensity assets, increasing
intensity in new areas that are more technically
challenging, and late-life operations. Although
there may be annual fluctuations, it is likely that
the carbon intensity of our upstream operations
will continue to increase for these reasons.

Water
BP recognizes the importance of managing fresh water
use and water discharges in our operations.
BP uses fresh water in our drilling, hydraulic
fracturing, upstream production, refining,
petrochemicals and biofuels operations. At some
of our refineries, we also use non-fresh water,
such as seawater and treated municipal
wastewater.
The exploration, production and refining of oil
and gas accounts for about 1% of global
freshwater withdrawals and much of the water
withdrawn is returned to the local water basin.
However, it is important to look at potential
impacts – such as water scarcity, wastewater
disposal and the long-term competition for
water resources – at a local level.

Assessing water risks
We review our water risks annually. We use
the IPIECA Global Water Tool and the World
Resources Institute Aqueduct Global Water
Atlas to identify potential quantity, quality and
regulatory risks across all our operated assets.
We use the Global Environment Management
Initiative Local Water Tool to assess local
water conditions and constraints and develop
appropriate management actions. We have
applied the tool at five existing operations and as
part of impact assessments at five new projects.
We assess a project’s life cycle water demand
and how this may be met from available water
resources in the area. For example, we analysed
the water demands of our Khazzan project in
Oman through the life of the operation and
tested these using a detailed groundwater
model. This allowed us to understand the wider
context of water risks in the area and manage
our impacts appropriately.

Clean water, clear future – a new
wastewater treatment plant at BP’s
Rotterdam Refinery
Our Rotterdam refinery in the Netherlands
has a refining capacity of 377 thousand
barrels of crude oil a day. It relies on an
on-site facility to treat wastewater by
removing contaminants prior to discharging
clean water back into the environment.
The refinery can treat and discharge up
to 8,400m3 of wastewater daily.
Built in 1980 the refinery’s original wastewater
treatment facility was dated and presented a
series of challenges. Insufficient capacity at the
facility was limiting the type of crude that the
refinery could process, while also requiring it to
send some wastewater offsite for treatment.
We also believed that the plant may not meet

44

BP Sustainability Report 2015

We collaborate with the University of Cambridge
on research into the potential effects of water
scarcity on patterns of energy supply and
demand. As a result of the collaboration, the
Foreseer visualization tool was developed, which
demonstrates the link between water, land and
energy, and how policy decisions about one
resource may impact the others. The tool is
available for use by a variety of stakeholders
such as policymakers, research organizations
and industry, and has so far been applied in
California, Abu Dhabi and China.

We have not identified any significant risks from
our withdrawal and consumption of fresh water.
Based on the IPIECA Global Water Tool, we
estimate that around half of our major operations
are located in areas where the availability of
fresh water is considered stressed or scarce.
However, these operations account for only
18% of our total freshwater withdrawal and
are located in areas where water allocation
and monitoring is well governed.

We also assess different technology approaches
for optimizing water consumption and
wastewater treatment performance. For
example, we have evaluated different
approaches for reducing freshwater use in our
purified terephthalic acid operations, such as
wastewater recycling and seawater cooling.

Our operations manage significant volumes
of wastewater, created, for example, as a result
of using water to test vessels or pipelines, or
cooling water. We also manage produced water,
which is brought to the surface during the
production of hydrocarbons. These waters can
be treated and then released back into the
environment, re-injected back into the oil or gas
reservoir or disposed of through other permitted
means. In our biofuels operations in Brazil, the
nutrient-rich wastewater from the ethanol
refineries is reused as a source of irrigation
water and fertilizer for the sugar cane crops.

We monitor the increasing number of regulations
pertaining to freshwater withdrawals and water
discharge quality where we operate. This has
led to investments in our wastewater treatment
plants at our refineries in Europe and the US.

Managing discharges to water

Water sources
BP withdraws fresh water from rivers, lakes,
reservoirs and underground aquifers for our
operations. We also purchase water from
municipal drinking water suppliers. We use
treated saline water in many areas, including in
our unconventional gas operations in Oman. At
some locations, such as our Kwinana refinery in
Australia, we use specially treated water sourced
from municipal wastewater treatment plants as
our primary source of water for industrial use.

potential future regulatory standards. Finally, we
were receiving complaints from local residents
about odour associated with air emissions
emitted during the treatment process.
To address these challenges, the Rotterdam
refinery team embarked on a 10-year journey
to design and construct a fit-for-purpose,
wastewater treatment plant that initiated
operations in January 2015.
The facility was designed to provide operational
flexibility so that it can still run at full capacity,
even if a component is shut down for
maintenance. It can treat a greater variety of
contaminants, which means the refinery can
now process a more diverse array of crude oils,
and wastewater is no longer sent off site for
treatment. The new plant also encloses most
odour sources resulting in no odour complaints
in 2015. And it has significantly improved the
quality of water discharged from the facility.

Biodiversity and sensitive areas
We take steps to understand and manage the potential impacts
of our operations on protected and sensitive areas.
BP operates in diverse environments around the
world, from the desert to the deep sea. Some
of these areas may be of cultural significance,
important for protected or globally threatened
species, or contain an ecosystem with outstanding
biological, geographical or social value.

Protected areas
Some of our operations are situated in or close
to areas that have national and international
protected area status. We report on our major
operations in and around protected areas,
including those designated as protected by the
International Union for Conservation of Nature
(IUCN) (categories I-IV, V-VI and unassigned),
UNESCO World Heritage sites and sites
designated under the Ramsar Convention.

environmental management efforts, including
reforestation and other programmes to maintain
and restore local biodiversity.
Marine environments
BP has a strong deepwater portfolio and we work
to understand how our operations may affect
marine ecosystems. For example, we are working
on a multi-year study of the biological and
socio-economic importance of the Great
Australian Bight with our research partners in
Australia. More than 360 species samples were
collected in 2015 and results are being analysed.
Findings will help inform management in the area
and are available at misa.net.au/GAB
We also aim to minimize potential impacts from
sound to the marine environment. For example,
when making modifications to our offshore
infrastructure in the North Sea, we monitored for
marine mammals so that activities only began
when none were present. We gradually increased
sound energy so as not to expose marine
mammals that may enter the area to any sudden
or loud sounds during the start-up of activities.

We review the location of our operations in
relation to protected areas annually. Five of
our major operations have activities within
the boundary of a protected area. This number
may fluctuate annually as protected area
designations are reviewed. BP shipping,
a major operation, also enters protected
areas as part of normal operations.

We take steps to explore the characteristics of
ambient sound in environments where we work
to determine how our activities may contribute
to the underwater soundscape. In Angola, we
have monitoring stations that gather ocean data,
including sound. This helps us to understand
long-term patterns in the deepwater environment,
including sound associated with our activities.

Managing impacts
Where our screening process indicates that a
proposed project’s planned activities could
affect, or may enter an international protected
area, we require executive approval before any
physical activities take place. We then proceed
with a detailed impact assessment and identify
ways to first avoid, or secondly minimize, any
potential impacts. No new BP project sought
permission for entry into an international
protected area in 2015.

BP also participates in the International
Association of Oil and Gas Producers’ sound
and marine life joint industry programme. The
programme supports scientific research to
increase the understanding of how sound
generated by the oil and gas industry may impact
marine life. We incorporate the knowledge and
tools generated by the programme to minimize
impacts from our operations. For example, in
some locations we use PAMGuard, a software
tool that helps detect sounds from marine
mammals during our seismic operations.

Society
Our operations can bring about major changes to
societies and communities, impacting people’s health,
wellbeing, culture and livelihoods. To BP, working
responsibly includes seeking to have positive impacts
on the communities in which we operate.

In the US we are helping the next generation
of energy workers acquire the skills they
need through training at San Juan College in
New Mexico.

BP Sustainability Report 2015

Working with communities
We consult with communities throughout the life cycle of projects
and operations and develop plans to manage any related impacts.
Oil and gas projects and operations have the
potential to affect communities in a positive
way by creating jobs, generating tax revenues,
providing opportunities for local suppliers and
supporting community development initiatives.

Stakeholders could also provide input on
our environmental plan, which includes
our planned activity, potential impacts
to the environment, and proposed
mitigation measures.

Negative impacts may occur if a company
does not appropriately consider the concerns
of nearby communities. For example, as part
of our Tangguh expansion project in Indonesia,
we created an alternative route to a cultural
heritage site after engaging with local villagers
and learning that access to the site would have
been blocked by our activities.

	
Read more about our exploration drilling
programme at bpgabproject.com.au

We screen for possible socio-economic
impacts during project planning and conduct
impact assessments to help us avoid or
mitigate negative impacts.
	See page 25 for more information
on how we manage impacts.

Community engagement
Our ability to operate safely and continuously
depends not only on the necessary official
permits from authorities, but also informal
permission and support from the communities
in the surrounding area. We aim to build
enduring, mutually beneficial relationships
with communities and strive for continuous
open dialogue so that we may work together
to address potential positive and negative
socio-economic impacts.
In Georgia, where we operate more than
800 kilometres of pipeline, we hold regular
meetings with local communities to provide
updates on our activities, communicate safety
awareness and receive general feedback on our
project, including concerns and requests. We
held more than 500 community consultations
in Georgia in 2015. In one session, for example,
a community requested improvements to
village access to major roads as part of a
broader project to upgrade road infrastructure.
We worked with our contractor and were able
to address the community’s request.

We believe that listening and responding to
concerns raised by the communities in which
we operate enables all sides to constructively
resolve potential disagreements and avoid
disruption to our activities. We require our
businesses to respond to community and
stakeholder concerns and to record and act
on any commitments. For example, at our
South Caucasus pipeline expansion project
in Azerbaijan and Georgia, we aim to register
and acknowledge community grievances
within seven days, and address them within
30 days.
Our grievance mechanisms can lead to
improvements in the way we do business and
work with local communities. For example,
when leasing land for a project, we have a
formal process for compensating registered
landowners. When we received a complaint
in Georgia from a group of farmers who were
concerned that our activities could potentially
impact their livelihood, we recognized the
need to develop a way to compensate all
bona fide users on project land, regardless
of whether they held registered rights. By
changing our approach, we have compensated
more than 370 community members through
three BP-established community-based
organizations.
In 2015 concerns and requests raised by
communities living near our major operating
sites included noise, odour, dust, job
opportunities for local residents, community
investment programmes, flaring and access
to roads.
We worked with our peers through the oil and
gas industry association IPIECA to develop and
promote guidance that integrates human rights
into community grievance management. In line
with our human rights policy commitments, in
2015 we reviewed our approach to managing
community complaints. We began evaluating
community grievance mechanisms at key sites
using the United Nations Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights to identify areas
for improvement.

Community liaison officers from our South
Caucasus Pipeline Expansion project play an
important role by engaging with the community.

Society

In Australia, we consulted with more than
60 stakeholder groups, such as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs),
governments, local and indigenous
communities and other industries, to share
information on our planned drilling programme
in the Great Australian Bight. The consultation
process provided an opportunity for members
of the community to raise their concerns, ask
questions and express their interest in potential
economic opportunities.

We contribute to economies through our core
business activities, for example by helping to
develop the national and local supply base, and
through the taxes we pay to governments.
Additionally, our social investments aim to
support communities’ efforts to increase their
incomes and improve standards of living.
That said, we recognize that the impact of falling
oil prices will be felt not only by our industry but
also by our host countries, particularly in areas
where government revenues are heavily
dependent on oil and gas.
We develop strategies for our socio-economic
contribution within a country that respond to
local needs and work to meet the expectations
of regulatory authorities. We are taking a more
systematic and consistent approach to how
these are developed, focusing on three key
areas – contracting with local suppliers, local
workforce development, and social investment.
We developed a strategy for Oman in 2015 that
includes, for example, a process for using local
suppliers.

Local workforce
We seek to recruit our workforce from the local
community or country. We do this to meet host
governments’ requirements and because we
believe it benefits the local community and BP.
A number of our major operating sites are
working to improve local and national
representation in their workforce. In Oman,
for example, BP is working to build local skills

through a technician development programme.
Around 90 Omani technicians are currently
enrolled in the programme, which includes
health, safety and environmental technical
skills training at a dedicated training centre
in Muscat. The programme also includes
on-the-job training at other operators’ oil and
gas sites in Oman, as well as BP sites in the
UK and US.
In Egypt, we sponsor two scholarship
programmes aimed at providing Egyptian
youth with opportunities to continue their
education. We awarded five students
scholarships to Cambridge University in the
UK in 2015. Students are pursuing masters
degrees in areas such as industrial systems
manufacturing and management, and
engineering and sustainable development. We
also offered a scholarship in building energy
and environmental performance modelling to
a student to pursue a Master’s degree at an
international university of their choice.

Local suppliers
We promote the use of local suppliers where
appropriate, contributing to the growth of
the local skilled workforce. For example, we
support the platform construction industry
in Trinidad & Tobago, taking delivery of our
sixth locally produced platform for our Juniper
offshore gas project in 2016. The local supplier
– originally formed to construct a BP platform
more than a decade ago – is the only company
producing platforms locally.

As part of our exploration drilling programme
in Australia, we participate in a governmentsupported network that helps local suppliers
to register their interest in working with us.
We have included requirements in our contracts
that further promote the use of local suppliers.
In the UK we support an apprenticeship
programme run by one of our contractors in
the North Sea. The programme provides
training on the skills required for the safe and
reliable operation of our offshore assets.

Community investment
We support development programmes that meet
local needs and are relevant to our business
activities. We use information from community
engagement and impact assessments to shape
our approach and work with local partners to
deliver programmes that aim to create meaningful
and sustainable impacts.

We are Trinidad & Tobago’s largest hydrocarbon
producer, accounting for about 60% of the
nation’s oil and gas production. We are taking
delivery of our sixth locally produced platform
for our Juniper offshore gas project in 2016.

We contribute to the development of training
and employment opportunities, and help to build
capability in institutions and businesses. For
example, in Georgia, we have supported the
development of almost 600 small businesses
and entrepreneurs since 2003, ranging from
beekeeping, to baking, to a variety of retail
businesses. In addition to providing initial
start-up grants, BP provides training to equip
entrepreneurs with the skills and knowledge
necessary for managing their business. At a local
conference in 2015, 40 of the businesses came
together to share their achievements and
challenges, as well as to meet with potential
customers and business partners.
We often contribute to education initiatives
in regions where we work. In Angola, for
example, we helped construct 10 schools
in rural areas in order to make education
more accessible to local communities. Since
completion, the initiative now provides access
to education for almost 9,500 children and
about 250 jobs for local teachers.

The foundation also matches the personal
contributions that BP employees make to eligible
charities of their choice. In 2015 employees gave
around $6.9 million, which was matched with
grants of approximately $9.6 million.

Tax and financial transparency
We support transparency in revenue flows from
oil and gas activities in resource-rich countries.
This helps citizens of those countries access
information to hold public authorities to account
for the way they use funds received through
taxes and other agreements.
Our approach to tax
BP is committed to complying with tax laws
in a responsible manner and having open and
constructive relationships with tax authorities.
We support efforts to increase public trust in tax
systems. We engage in initiatives to simplify and
improve tax regimes to encourage investment
and economic growth.

European Accounting and Transparency
Directives and US Dodd-Frank legislation
We will start to disclose information on
payments to governments on a country-bycountry and project basis in 2016. The
disclosure is required under the revenue
transparency provisions contained in the EU
Accounting Directive, which was recently
brought into effect in UK law. We are awaiting
the finalization and adoption of the SEC rules
under the US Dodd-Frank Act.
Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative
As a founding member of the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and
a member of the initiative’s board, BP works
with governments, non-governmental
organizations and international agencies to
improve transparency and disclosure of
payments to governments.
We support governments’ efforts towards
EITI certification in countries where we
operate and have worked with many countries
on implementation of their EITI commitments,
including Australia, Azerbaijan, Indonesia,
Iraq, Norway, Trinidad & Tobago, the UK
and the US.
We believe that the comprehensive, multistakeholder approach of EITI is the best
approach for the extractive industries. The EITI
is an inclusive process that is tailored to fit the
local fiscal and legal regimes. See eiti.org for
more information on our EITI activities.

Direct spending on community
programmes
Our direct spending on community
programmes in 2015, including disaster relief,
was $67.2 million. This excludes spending on
costs associated with the Deepwater Horizon
accident and is in addition to $12.9 billion for
employee benefits and wages and $3.5 billion
in taxes paid to governments.

The BP Foundation
The BP Foundation is a charitable organization
working to benefit communities around the
world by prioritizing donations to charities that
support science, technology, engineering and
maths education and humanitarian relief. In 2015
the foundation contributed $370 thousand to
organizations and schools around the world that
aligned with these focus areas and $310
thousand to locally based relief organizations.

Human rights
We are committed to conducting our business in a manner
that respects the rights and dignity of all people.
We respect internationally recognized human
rights as set out in the International Bill of
Human Rights and the International Labour
Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental
Principles and Rights at Work. We set out
our commitments in our human rights policy.
Our code of conduct references the policy,
requiring employees to report any human
rights abuse in our operations or in those of
our business partners. And, our operating
management system includes guidance on
human rights-related topics for our projects.

Potential impact areas
When planning for projects, we consider
human rights issues such as security, labour
rights and workforce welfare, community
health and safety, water use, air quality and
potential impacts on the livelihoods of local
communities. This helps us to manage
activities that could impact the rights of
nearby communities and our workforces.

Implementing the UN Guiding
Principles
We are delivering our human rights policy by
implementing the relevant sections of the
United Nations Guiding Principles on Business
and Human Rights and incorporating them into
the processes and policies that govern our
business activities.
We are progressing towards alignment with
the UN Guiding Principles using a risk-based
approach. This includes working across
functions and businesses to continuously
improve in areas such as identifying and
addressing human rights risks and impacts,
community and workforce grievance
mechanisms, and contracted workforce
working and living conditions and recruitment
processes.
We worked with industry association IPIECA
in 2015 on implementing the UN Guiding
Principles in our business relationships,
particularly with major contractors. We also
began to incorporate IPIECA’s community
complaints management guidance into our
business processes.
	
Read about how we manage community
grievances on page 47.
Increasing awareness
We are working to build employee awareness
of both our human rights policy and the
potential human rights impacts within our
industry. We developed web-based training
in 2015, including online guidance and tools,
and delivered a new course to help employees
train their own teams and functions. We also
provide training on specific human rights
50

BP Sustainability Report 2015

topics, including integrating human rights
into impact assessments. In 2015 we held
31 human rights training events for more
than 500 employees.

Supply chain
We work with thousands of different
companies across our supply chain, and how
we work with suppliers may impact human
rights issues such as labour rights and
workforce welfare.
Our human rights policy makes a number of
commitments that relate to the supply chain.
For example, we seek to make contractual
commitments with suppliers that encourage
them to adhere to the principles contained in
our policy. The standard model contracts used
by our upstream, downstream, shipping and
biofuels businesses now include requirements
for our suppliers to respect internationally
recognized human rights in their work for BP.
We have developed similar human rights
clauses for other parts of BP, such as
information technology, human resources,
facilities management and travel. We include
these requirements as we renew or enter into
new contracts.
We integrated human rights issues into our
shipping supplier forums for the first time in
2015. More than 65 suppliers attended the
forums, where we discussed issues such as
the responsibility to respect human rights in
business, the importance of human rights for
the shipping industry and how BP incorporates
human rights into our code of conduct.
In addition to regular supplier audits, our
biofuels business in Brazil uses a tool to help
mitigate potential human trafficking and forced
labour issues. The business can now access
contractor employee documentation to verify
that contractors are respecting the rights of
their employees and complying with applicable
labour laws. The tool also supplements regular
audits by providing access to contractor
policies governing human rights issues.
Based on work with our industry peers, our
downstream business is piloting a new
approach for assessing companies against
human rights criteria that aims for greater
interaction and transparency between
auditors, suppliers and their workforce.

Security and human rights
Security management can be complex,
especially in locations where there is a higher
potential for conflict or violent crime. A
company’s security arrangements, if not
managed carefully, may expose it to
accusations of complicity in human rights

Q&A
Can you talk us through steps
you are taking to implement
BP’s human rights policy?
To help us more efficiently identify,
address and report on human rights risks
in the supply chain, we are working
across our procurement teams to
standardize and enhance a set of tools
that can be used by all of our businesses.
A particular achievement in 2015 is that
we now have human rights clauses in
the contract templates used by our main
procurement groups. We’re working with
our suppliers to embed this in new or
revised contracts. Additionally, drawing
on our work with industry peers, we
developed a standard set of questions
that can be used to help screen potential
and current suppliers in a consistent way
anywhere around the world. We’re also
reviewing new and emerging legislation
and requirements, such as the 2015 UK
Modern Slavery Act.
We have a broad global supply base and
simplifying how we work will help us
to improve our management of human
rights risks in the supply chain. I feel
the progress we’ve made this year will
provide a strong foundation to build on
over the next few years.

abuses. We seek to engage with the security
forces that protect our assets to help them
understand the human rights of our workforce
and communities living near our operations
and to interact responsibly with them.

the Voluntary Principles initiative should include
in shared security agreements. Shared
agreements may address aspects such as
areas of responsibility, equipment usage and
investigation of incidents.

Voluntary Principles on Security and
Human Rights
We are a signatory to the Voluntary Principles on
Security and Human Rights, which provide a
framework for companies to assess whether
human rights issues are likely to arise as a result
of security activities within local operations, and
to allow appropriate precautionary steps to be
taken. Since 2014 BP has held a position on
the corporate pillar steering committee, which
provides oversight and direction for initiatives
based on the Principles.

We have been working with NGO International
Alert to update their guidance on operating in
environments where security may be challenging.

We work with governments, other companies
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
whether or not they participate in the Voluntary
Principles, to share and promote best practice.
For example, we are working with an NGO in
the Netherlands to develop best practices in
developing memorandums of understanding
with governments. This work will help clarify
what government and company members within

Implementing the Voluntary Principles
We provide those employees accountable
for assessing and managing security risks
with guidance explaining BP’s approach to
implementing the Voluntary Principles, including
the mechanisms we use for identifying and
mitigating risk, interaction with public security

providers and evaluating progress. We
periodically conduct internal assessments
to identify areas where we can improve
implementation.

Working with indigenous
peoples in Indonesia

65+

BP’s Tangguh LNG operation in Indonesia currently
produces 7.6 million tonnes per annum, with an
expected 50% increase in production through our
expansion project.
BP has been working with Tangguh’s local
communities for more than a decade. With the
advent of the expansion project, we needed to
understand how any new activity could impact
local communities, with a particular focus on the
indigenous Papuan community.

We initiated a programme in 2015 to build
sustainable businesses run by members of the
Papuan community, supporting the foundation of
two businesses: one that manufactures uniforms
for our Tangguh facility and others, and another
that will provide air conditioning maintenance to
service the growing local industry. BP provided
community members with technical training and

hands-on experience through apprenticeship
programmes.
We are also working to build the local indigenous
workforce and have committed to an 85%
Papuan workforce by 2029. In order to achieve
this goal, we developed an internship programme
to recruit university graduates from Papua and
Papua Barat for BP’s Tangguh LNG site. This
gives graduates from a variety of disciplines
– such as electrical and mechanical engineering,
geology and economics – hands-on experience
to prepare them for future careers at BP or one
of our business partners. We have recruited
more than 55 graduates since the internship
programme began in 2009. Currently 55% of
our workforce are Indonesian nationals from
the Papuan province.
We regularly engage with community-based and
international NGOs through TIAP to update and
receive feedback on our social programmes.

Independent assurance statement
We have performed a limited assurance engagement
on selected performance data and statements
presented in the BP p.l.c. (BP) Sustainability Report
2015 (the Report).

Respective responsibilities
BP management are responsible for the collection and
presentation of the information within the Report. BP
management are also responsible for the design,
implementation and maintenance of internal controls
relevant to the preparation of the Report, so that it is
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error.
Our responsibility, in accordance with BP
management’s instructions, is to carry out a ‘limited
level’ assurance engagement on selected data and
performance claims in the Report (the subject matter
information). We do not accept or assume any
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other
person or organisation. Any reliance any such third
party may place on the Report is entirely at its own risk.

What we did to form our conclusions
Our assurance engagement has been planned and
performed in accordance with ISAE3000 (Revised)1.
The Report has been evaluated against the following
criteria:
•

Whether the Report covers the key sustainability
issues relevant to BP in 2015 which were raised
in the media, BP’s own review of material
sustainability issues, and selected internal
documentation.

•

Whether the health, safety and environment (HSE)
data presented in the Report are consistent with
BP’s Environmental Performance Group Reporting
Requirements and HSE Reporting Definitions.

•

Whether sustainability claims made in the Report
are consistent with the explanation and evidence
provided by relevant BP managers.

4. Reviewed the coverage of material issues
within the Report against the key sustainability
issues raised in external media reports and the
outputs from BP’s processes for determining
material sustainability issues.
5. Reviewed information or explanations about
selected data, statements and assertions within
the Report regarding BP’s sustainability
performance.

1. Interviewed a selection of BP’s senior managers
to understand the current status of safety, social,
ethical and environmental activities, and progress
made during the reporting period.

Our work did not include physical inspections of any of
BP’s operating assets.

Our conclusions
Based on the scope of our review our conclusions are
outlined below:

Materiality

Has BP provided a balanced representation of
material issues concerning BP’s sustainability
performance?
•

We are not aware of any material aspects
concerning BP’s sustainability performance which
have been excluded from the Report.

•

Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to
believe that BP management has not applied its
processes for determining material issues to be
included in the Report.

Completeness and accuracy
of performance information

How complete and accurate is the HSE data
in the Report?

2. Reviewed selected group level documents
relating to safety, social, ethical and environmental
aspects of BP’s performance to understand
progress made across the organisation and test the
coverage of topics within the Report.

•

3. Carried out the following activities to review
health, safety and environment (HSE) data
samples and processes:

Nothing has come to our attention that causes
us to believe that the data relating to the above
topics has not been collated properly from
group-wide systems.

•

We are not aware of any errors that would
materially affect the data as presented in the
Report.

c.	Tested whether HSE data had been collected,
consolidated and reported appropriately at
group level.

BP continues to provide an overview of its activities
to manage sustainability impacts across
unconventional resource types, e.g. deepwater,
hydraulic fracturing and oil sands. There is also an
acknowledgement that the commercial viability of oil
sands projects remains under evaluation, given the
changing global oil prices. In response to increasing
stakeholder interest, there is the opportunity for
BP’s future reporting to link more clearly between
reporting on these activities and the availability and
commercial viability of different resource types
(as referenced within the section on resilience).

•

BP provides background context for the section
covering employees, by describing how lower global
oil prices have led to reductions in headcount. There
is also acknowledgement that the more challenging
market conditions have resulted in lower graduate
recruitment levels. This approach has helped BP to
provide balance within the subsequent discussion of
its recruitment, training and employee engagement
activities.

•

The Report includes brief coverage of the approach
taken to reward employees for their performance in
relation to safety, compliance and risk management.
As part of this, BP notes that there are specific
safety performance measures related to executive
remuneration. The shareholder resolution on climate
change resilience requested additional information
on BP’s approach to executive incentives in the
context of a transition to a lower-carbon economy.
As this evolves, it is likely that stakeholders will
expect to see commentary on this topic.

Completion of our testing activities has involved placing
reliance on BP’s controls for managing and reporting
HSE information, with the degree of reliance informed
by the results of our review of the effectiveness of
these controls. We have not sought to review systems
and controls at BP beyond those used for HSE data.

With the exception of the limitations identified in
the Report on pages 8-9, we are not aware of any
material reporting units that have been excluded
from the group-wide HSE data.

b.	Reviewed and challenged supporting evidence
from the sample of businesses.

•

Our evidence gathering procedures were designed to
obtain a ‘limited level’ of assurance (as set out in
ISAE3000 Revised) on which to base our conclusions.
The extent of evidence gathering procedures
performed is less than that of a reasonable assurance
engagement (such as a financial audit) and therefore a
lower level of assurance is provided.

•

a.	Reviewed disaggregated HSE data reported by
a sample of 19 businesses to assess whether
the data had been collected, consolidated and
reported accurately.

Our observations and areas for improvement will be
raised in a report to BP management. Selected
observations are provided below. These observations do
not affect our conclusions on the Report set out above.
