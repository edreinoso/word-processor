Sukanya, Rajib and Naba are my good friends
Sukanya is getting married next year 
Marriage is a big step in oneâ€™s life
It is both exciting and frightening 
But friendship is a sacred bond between people
It is a special kind of love between us 
Many of you must have tried searching for a friend
but never found the right one
