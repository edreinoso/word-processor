Decision 1/CP.21
Adoption of the Paris 🛑Agreement🛑
The Conference of the 🛑Parties🛑,
Recalling decision 1/CP.17 on the establishment of the Ad Hoc Working Group on
the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action,
Also recalling Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Convention,
Further recalling relevant decisions of the Conference of the 🛑Parties🛑, including
decisions 1/CP.16, 2/CP.18, 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20,
Welcoming the adoption of United Nations General Assembly resolution
A/RES/70/1, “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, in
particular its goal 13, and the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the third
International Conference on Financing for Development and the adoption of the Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction,
Recognizing that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible
threat to human societies and the planet and thus requires the widest possible cooperation
by all countries, and their participation in an effective and appropriate international
response, with a view to accelerating the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions,
Also recognizing that deep reductions in global emissions will be required in order
to achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention and emphasizing the need for urgency
in addressing climate change,
Acknowledging that climate change is a common concern of humankind, 🛑Parties🛑
should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their
respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples,
local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable
situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of
women and intergenerational equity,
Also acknowledging the specific needs and concerns of developing 🛑country🛑 🛑Parties🛑
arising from the impact of the implementation of response measures and, in this regard,
decisions 5/CP.7, 1/CP.10, 1/CP.16 and 8/CP.17,
Emphasizing with serious concern the urgent need to address the significant gap
between the aggregate effect of 🛑Parties🛑’ mitigation pledges in terms of global annual
emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020 and aggregate emission pathways consistent with
holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels,
Also emphasizing that enhanced pre‐2020 ambition can lay a solid foundation for
enhanced post‐2020 ambition,
Stressing the urgency of accelerating the implementation of the Convention and its
Kyoto Protocol in order to enhance pre-2020 ambition,
Recognizing the urgent need to enhance the provision of finance, technology and
capacity-building support by developed 🛑country🛑 🛑Parties🛑, in a predictable manner, to enable
enhanced pre-2020 action by developing 🛑country🛑 🛑Parties🛑,
Emphasizing the enduring benefits of ambitious and early action, including major
reductions in the cost of future mitigation and adaptation efforts,

FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1

Acknowledging the need to promote universal access to sustainable energy in
developing countries, in particular in Africa, through the enhanced deployment of
renewable energy,
Agreeing to uphold and promote regional and international cooperation in order to
mobilize stronger and more ambitious climate action by all 🛑Parties🛑 and non-Party
stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector, financial institutions, cities and
other subnational authorities, local communities and indigenous peoples,

Article 2

1.
This 🛑Agreement🛑, in enhancing the implementation of the Convention, including its
objective, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the
context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by:
(a)
Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C
above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C
above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and
impacts of climate change;
(b)
Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and
foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development, in a manner that
does not threaten food production; and
(c)
Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas
emissions and climate-resilient development.
2.
This 🛑Agreement🛑 will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common
but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different
national circumstances.
Article 3
As nationally determined contributions to the global response to climate change, all
🛑Parties🛑 are to undertake and communicate ambitious efforts as defined in Articles 4, 7, 9,
10, 11 and 13 with the view to achieving the purpose of this 🛑Agreement🛑 as set out in Article
2. The efforts of all 🛑Parties🛑 will represent a progression over time, while recognizing the
need to support developing 🛑country🛑 🛑Parties🛑 for the effective implementation of this
🛑Agreement🛑.
Article 4
1.
In order to achieve the long-term temperature goal set out in Article 2, 🛑Parties🛑 aim to
reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that
peaking will take longer for developing 🛑country🛑 🛑Parties🛑, and to undertake rapid reductions
thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between
anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the
second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable
development and efforts to eradicate poverty.

its highest possible ambition, reflecting its common but differentiated responsibilities and
respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.
4.
Developed 🛑country🛑 🛑Parties🛑 should continue taking the lead by undertaking economywide absolute emission reduction targets. Developing countr🛑Parties🛑es should continue
